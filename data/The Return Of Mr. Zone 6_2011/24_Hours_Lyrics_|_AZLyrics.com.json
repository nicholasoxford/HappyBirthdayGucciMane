New album, it's Gucci\nCut up something Cory\n\n[Verse:]\nDamn it's a good day. Damn it's a good day\nCall Drumma boy and told him let's go make a hood tape\nFirst thang I'm a do pull out my 7'4\nCandy coated black things sitting on them 40 O's\n24 towers, 8 bricks of powder, 10 bells of dro\nWhat I payed for the flour\nDon't talk about my lambo, talk about my Rarri\nTalk about my Phantom, talk about my Harley\nBrick Squad Biker boy, angel named Charlie\nGoons going psycho white boy gnarly\nEvery 24 seconds passing me the Marley\nLames tryna diss don't effect me hardly\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm up 24 hours, money and the power\nStunting on the hoes and I'm shitting on the cowards\nUp 24 hours\nI'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours\nNo shit shave or shower\nUntil I get my money back\nI gotta get my money up\n24 hours. I'm up 24 hours\n\nIt's Gucci!\n\n[Verse:]\nI'm going to the bank again making a deposit,\nIt's getting kinda chilly bring my minks up out the closet\nGetting kinda warm get my jewerly out the safe\nIf it be a problem put the hater in his place\nI'm slicker than an oil spill\nSharper than a razor\nI'm screaming anybody get it like my nigga Major\nFinna cop a condo and fill it up with ammo\nBrick Squad Bandana on I think I'm fucking Rambo\nIt's Gucci\nI'm a killer so don't push me\nBrick Squad ain't no pussy niggas\nRunning with them wig splittas\nNiggas screaming roll one\nGucci let me hold some\nBut I can't let you hold none\nI hit you with the whole drum\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm up 24 hours, money and the power\nStunting on the hoes and shitting on the cowards\nSo 24 hours\nI'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours\nNo shit, shave or shower\nUntil I get my money back\nI gotta get my money up\nI'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours\n\n[Verse:]\nI'm fucking with a white girl you can call me Ice-T\nCause I got my crystals on you can call em Spike Lee\nRobbin me unlikely last try I drop em\nHollow tip stopped em\nI ain't have time to box him\nStunting like an actor\nRunning like an athlete\nStrait to the money like a sprinter at a track meet\nFirst signed Waka, then I signed Gucci\nThen I sign Brick Squad tell em come sue me\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nI'm up 24 hours, money and the power\nStunting on the hoes and shitting on the cowards\nSo 24 hours\nI'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours\nNo shit, shave or shower\nUntil I get my money back\nI gotta get my money up\nI'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_14918075/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAPY3_Xk-NduQXJQn28jj5H3WaLlpQyvMzL3z_PP8jpx8TQKzDpgvlWhE4YHkxOOeuj7o4AlPAV9-ARULnud9fE4N0qPs-uqsX70FU9Cndxn1OpdA0Ioaxas06MLqBRkmLeTHDB9TyIOyP5Jz8xB8QKti2uachyORq43DTcqTtdQYQhGN_3fzlWluJm2RXbeTBrtzwls5iujugnnMQ4K60q9Ct-j0og3gcWesZsbO6HrojVGIn7mhjCYt7Y4muT1Xqg3XpRRqnm7wMr4oMIYWMQV7_P3oYMuDe7whD9vBXn8V9DrSZ1a-3Fclz8-U9g4uesX7tFHMkwZ8nOD1fkWm4224KLMLXhWzHpNG-pHqVQTlvsGCxEGYHC323czXOPb0qDS31ySjdnWU7_6ao4gDboM48rhMcdF_hUjcKYeNRVhRSeliq_Vrj8G3dgo/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\nThanks to Aric McPherson for correcting these lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Davis Radric Delantic, Gholson Christopher James\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"The Return Of Mr. Zone 6\" (2011)\n24 Hours\nMouth Full Of Gold\nThis Is What I Do\nReckless\nShout Out To My Set\nI Don't Love Her\nBetter Baby\nBrinks\nPretty Bitches\nPancakes\nHell Yeah\nMy Year\nTrick Or Treat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
