Shout Out My Connect. Shout Out To My Check. Shout To My Check. Shout Out My Wrist & Neck. Shout Out My Wrist & Neck. Im A Man of Respect. Man of Respect. And Imma Nigga With A Check. Nigga With A Check. Imma Man of Respect. Man of Respect. A Nigga with A Check. Nigga With A Check.\n\n[Wooh Da Kidd:]\nShout Out To Your Main Bitch. Shout To Her Neck. It's Cold Outside I Aint Got Time To Play So Please Dont Get Wet. Its Just me With My Young Boy At Your Front Door With The Teck. Aint Shit For Free. That's It For Me I Demand A Check. Shout Out To My Weed Man, I Call Him The Geek Squad. I Smoke Too Much, I Just Lost My Thoughts, I'm Feelin like A Retard. Got 2 Best Freaks Plus Me Riding In That 2 Seater. They Face To Face. Im By Myself But They Huggin Like A Wife Beater. Shout Out To My OG For Him Im Puttin In Work. Shout To Them Real Killa's Thats Puttin In That Twerk. Wooh Da Kidd A Real Nigga. Shout Out To My Set. Shout Out To My Bruler For My Wrist And Neck. Yes.\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Gucci:]\nShout Out To My Accountin, My Attorneys and My Manager. And Shout Out To My 26's Dat Sittin Up Under My Challenger. Imma Professional. Your An Amateur. Your An Artist. Im An Animal. I Eat Rubbers. Im Hannibal. Not Canibal. Im A Carnivore. Im A Dinosaur. Your A Herbivore. I Use Verbs Up Verbs You Aint Never Heard Before. Faith Trapper Never Sold Birds Before. Probably Never Even Use Dirty Words Before. But Not Me. Cant Stop Me. Aint No Hood Nigga Gonna Stop Me. Im Focus. Just Watch Me. I Send Out Shout Out To My Posy. I Send A Shout Out To My A-R. My Tek-9 And My AK. I Dont Play. Not A Day. Not A Way Im Gucci. Salute Me Or Shoot Me. Make Next Move Your Best Me. Every Move Around Me Is A Chest Move. Real Goon's Dont Aim For The Chest Fool. It's Gucci!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_6277838/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAGdxEa0W8vcfyiQ8aaF_kXWgqRmUMFEzgFgxVX4uoU1PjRuCPPssgvLAEMjszo0yMvl5Ik8naiuFSKNJXW7F2v5U7tgVM9KcwxIkZM7Nk8fOh8OlpXgxY6YlJ4PjlAo2Aief0LlsKZuPURi-hUz1xQxAj6tpFpLROPAKmK9OcPdFtlQiefSqb4N3q8abpHmX9EvED9W_uE4DXKBA9A-scmIJCvXACkR_DEJuQgPaf9hv7YUytqXDCwTyxc9CwLL0-FnRHUrf9x5fg0RdeZtXUEMAkVSqONR6PYDmgoHcOde8aD5soa-SkP572TRr0YBSEDYtPALabEG_3RShiXtVggJch6c4GFxFR06jtRplIICqqGl0XaWGRq3oqZ5lL_oEjqShJdTwXoFwogiOuARiSLrSuH0cGKOidXn_MyHKGn_dwIfpYIpWxguFe1TyvRr6Mb27RVd4jDQXwRbXpXXeGdSvtEB6xdyM9hOT6Q/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Davis Radric Delantic, Malphurs Nyquan, Luellen Joshua\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"The Return Of Mr. Zone 6\" (2011)\n24 Hours\nMouth Full Of Gold\nThis Is What I Do\nReckless\nShout Out To My Set\nI Don't Love Her\nBetter Baby\nBrinks\nPretty Bitches\nPancakes\nHell Yeah\nMy Year\nTrick Or Treat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
