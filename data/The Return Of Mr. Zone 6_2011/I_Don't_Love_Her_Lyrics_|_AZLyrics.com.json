See me down town, 'Rrari\nI didn't mean to shit on you. Excuse me, sorry\nVerse so slick, make my video marvelous\nPolo to the floor. Ralph'd down like Carlton\nTry the CEO, they goin' put you on a carton\nI didn't mean no harm but my diamonds are dumb, plenty rocks on my arm\nMe & Rocko the Don, East Atlanta the Slum\nWhere I'm from, got a gun, in the club havin fun\nAnd after it's done no more coaches to call it\nAfter party? Bachelor party, they shoulda called it\n\n[Hook: x2]\nI love things about her (but I don't love her)\nI love the way she treat me (but I don't love her)\nI love the way she fuck me (but I don't love her)\nI love the way she suck me (but I still don't love her)\n\n[Verse 2: Rocko]\nMan I love the way she shake it\nI like her cause she groovy\nLove to see her naked; I love to watch her move it\nI like her cause she the coolest\nA good head on her shoulders, I love the way she use it\nAye, I like the way she fuck me, love the way she suck me\nLove how everytime we play she catch it like rugby\nI love she know what's up with me, she love me cause I'm gudda\nI like a lot about her; though, but still I don't love her\nStill super cool though yeah she my lil buddy\nShe be sharper than a pencil\nYeah she my lil cuddy\nShawty say I'm dirty but when I see her she wanna hug me\nSuper swagger charismatic, all my bitches love me\n\n[Hook: x2]\nI love things about her (but don't love her)\nI love the way she treat me (but don't love her)\nI love the way she fuck me (but don't love her)\nI love the way she suck me (but still don't love her)\n\n[Verse 3: Webbie]\nI love how she be swallowin my nut, then she be throwin me up\nI like the way she fuck but still I hate when she be blowin me up\nAll the busters just sweat her, only ballers can get her\nShe a flipper, I love how she do whatever I tell her\nYeah I like her a lot, but still don't love her at all\nI hate pussy ass niggas, and I'm in love with the mall\nI got a crush on white diamonds and I got a thang for that kush\nThat sour diesel my favorite you betta watch how you look\nQuick to take ya lil diva and treat that ho like a slut\nShe was suckin on Gucci, I had my dick in her butt\nYou know I'm bad bitch crazy, 187's my favorite\nInfatuated with money, free Boosie-boo the streets pleading\n\n[Hook: x2]\nI love things about her (but don't love her)\nI love the way she treat me (but don't love her)\nI love the way she fuck me (but don't love her)\nI love the way she suck me (but still don't love her)\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_6365907/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCADj-9gGY6YSTU_epOqLSfad6jcqyRJIDYDyGcYp2jIoiV3l0P990zP3M5f1P5fzk45wetMqKKE64JtMyXpuAsaRqZQ_awf-jj9pQybaBJHcClLksEJDJ_rEE7DmZ9NCjXjGmv2hlnGh-GBMlSULFSIwhjzJ891E0Jb318PEIWirNCeV5eaDQopq45l1Vn-CxLRU9aqHEyUIE5dZrGf5bn7pJIY9aF62gtGfYgtD4f8qH6SLQmlXt-uWObTUmj4JF087RLJzQa7fTI39A4hkUvOFMP77h56xbU7gdu9oMOMaRP39ymnuDMwVNu4bLtQ-jIEwKmANvDiO-Q-OGatg81kJyou5hWvHuCoq10TdEeIwTHp0TLAw0E4-sPScJkZUC-isdTwtpqeCWnmaKk5-GFRrGEva3SZHJZOPSZxui6i54UI5RWsd4xHIpIfRzg9seJU055jBCDkPeRxCAcIaYRPDlGp0TFpNz1QHASdU/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Hill Rodney, Gradney Webster, Dotson Xavier, Davis Radric Delantic\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"The Return Of Mr. Zone 6\" (2011)\n24 Hours\nMouth Full Of Gold\nThis Is What I Do\nReckless\nShout Out To My Set\nI Don't Love Her\nBetter Baby\nBrinks\nPretty Bitches\nPancakes\nHell Yeah\nMy Year\nTrick Or Treat\n\n\nmixtape: \"Gucci 3D By Gucci Mane\" (2012)\nIntro (El Chapo)\nRooster In My Rari\nMake It Look Easy\nOutta Control\nDrug Lord (Snippet)\nDiamonds\nCome Fuck With Me\nHouse Around The Corner\nSway (Skit)\nHood Rich Anthem\nMVP\nShake Dat (Remix)\nAnytime You Ready\nMouf\nI Don't Love Her\n2 Girlz\nKnock 'Em Down\nSame Damn Time (Extended Remix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
