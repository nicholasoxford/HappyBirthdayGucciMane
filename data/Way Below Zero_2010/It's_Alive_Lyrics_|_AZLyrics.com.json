Swizz Beatz)\n\n\n\n[Intro: Swizz Beatz]\n1-2, 1-2, 1-2, burrr burrr\nThis is special, GUCCCI\nIts Gucci, thats what you mean huh..righht? right..\nLadies and gentleman, showtime\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz]\nMy pocket on swole, my rims on chrome\nWhen I hit the club, everything goes\nBottles in the air, put your lighters in the air\nBut when I'm in here, I dont really care\nCuz I ride on em, I style on em\nI lean on em, yes, I flash on em\nYeh I know, thats the way you like it, huh, yeh\nThats the way you love me, huh? Its alive..its alive\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nIt's alive, it's alive\nRims cut the eyes\nI had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein\nI push weight, but Gucci don't exercise\nI get extra from whippin up extra pies\nIm in the hood like the mayor round election time\nIt's a suggestion, don't park your car next to mine\nIma start when the light hit, Im 'posed to shine\nYour flow is garbage, they let me out just in time\nThey got a section, but none of the hoes are fine\nThey need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by\nI run laps around lames with my shoes untied\nI jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide\nStill stuck outside, that's the ugly side\nLooked medusa in the eye and medusa died\nThis is top secret shit, classified\nDon't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind\nCan't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time\nI got my chain moonwalkin, Michael Jackson time\nI keep on buying ice like I lost my mind\nThis bloodline of mine is supposed to shine\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]\nHurry up, hurry up Gucci on the news, they say he walked out the jail rockin stupid jewels\nThey try and find out what it do, admit it, you confused\nToo much cash on me, hundreds fallin out me, true\nBig yellow wrists, bright as piss, bitch Im the shit\nBig Gucci called Swizz, lets make a hit\n2 things in this world I ain't ever seen\nAre you a foreigner nigga? I need to help me get me me\nWell if your stomach cannot tote it baby, let me breathe\nCuz I dont check if no babe or bitch chasin me\nExcuse my French, bitch Im so Gucci, I so fuckin gutter\nIt dont make no sense to switch for none these mother fuckas\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]\nSomebody said my life is it\nI said nah dog, my wife is it\nNow I'm back, back on 'em like I never, never left\nPlus the boy right here, I'm fresh to death\nAnd the Black Card in my back pocket\nThe Conaseg lookin' like a speeder rocket\nYeah, I'm zoomin' on the highway\nAnd you should love me, I did it my way\n\n[Hook]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_6438305/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAC_EGgffQow3Ama7tj6eVYLPLZCjH_3JIFOuThmOqv5BZNzZzHbaBZZS0xgtu36bfh8V0_KOxhZm9c3up_c8kyBrEjw1S5JDCRhYr4azPvmacaFlFIB2CzZL6IgtCtIpflGGRhbGm00lPyvxxrt9fDT-c0WYJepBZ73cRca4z5GoKKASDfUGr-MIoaEQZFmoFyr-73vjZbEpN2IjHkz0X2chPsusjhpUAx3pGRoRVgCkFSICtrt_VG47qw0w-QTdukh599OlDnTayF7ajwTeX86DS3Wnx6vAjArp4e56e-UhK0sCqH640NLz27oTzSaSsFuusegMBuQtgkrJ-TErVhOCgASU7o6qH_EXa1oDCTJZba2TF0a9_g5ZKKGL1kkiooyOST7ZxBUyTYmbb_mXLN9FXpdsG5_1692dTWPii8xBIFfx8pdywVUCqQjurt2BeBeoQBvuiWc4LPsv2eB_w6SVZA/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Davis Radric Delantic, Dean Kasseem\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Way Below Zero\" (2010)\nBoogeyman\nDollar Sign\nMissing\nHoes\nTrap Talk\nBite Me\nDon't Believe Me\nYeahhh (Pop Your Back)\nVampire\nGucci Time\nIt's Alive\nMaybe (Remix)\n\n\nalbum: \"The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted\" (2010)\nLittle Friend\nTrap Talk\nMissing\nWhat It's Gonna Be\nMaking Love To The Money\nGucci Time\nParty Animal\nRemember When\nHaterade\nIt's Alive\nODog\nDollar Sign\nBrand New\nWeirdo\nGrown Man\nBeat It Up(iTunes Bonus Track)\nGeorgia's Most Wanted(iTunes Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
