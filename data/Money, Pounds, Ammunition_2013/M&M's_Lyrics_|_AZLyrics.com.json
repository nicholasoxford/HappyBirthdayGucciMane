than a million\nWith no M&M's on the low\nDon't fuck with no pee young niggas\nI put those M&M's on the road\nMe and my bitch Jay Z and Beyonce got\nThat ill money is all you owe\nI see them M&M nigga rachel blindfold\n\n[Verse 1:]\nTucking the kid again\nHoppin up on I can kill again\nFucking around with the M&M\nGot me taking up flashing them creeps again\nTell me do nothing but bitch in there\nHow can I how can I help you dear\nI only talk for some ear in your ear\nYour diamonds so clear, my maddam my dear\nI fly at the pizzle for a slice of that pizza\nMinus the Jay-Z with double Monifa\nBetter be careful don't look at me B\nType in your google and look foor peewee\nDull boy, I make you throw your thousands away\nIt's PeeWee Longway with the M&M\nMy bank accounts sayin no M&M\nThe benz I'm in is a concept\nThat bitch ain't even dry yet\nMy film pack is some molly\nTake off like a rocket\nThem hoes be sayin they're sick of him\nI adress my bitches she shit on them\nI make her beg as I set her lane\nThey callin her shit ridiculous\n\n[Hook:]\nYou a hussler nigga water whipping\nGetting it out the pole\nHow you countin up the mili nigga\nPut it on the road\nShe work for a quarter milly clapping her ass\nSliding down the pole\nShe fucking no million dollar nigga\nHe fucking no million dollar hoe\nNo M&M's\nHis home though more than a million\nWith no M&M's on the low\nDon't fuck with no pee young niggas\nI put those M&M's on the road\nMe and my bitch Jay Z and Beyonce got\nThat ill money is all you owe\nI see them M&M nigga rachel blindfold\n\n[Verse 2:]\nEvery hay bank account got M&M\nOG gang bang we ain't running through that\nPut gasoline all over in that air pom\nOn the road a long way blue to M&M\nAnd I don't fuck around with no peon\nCan't hit my weed hit a little long\nBig bird account give me that bee to hunt\nTrying 2 dues on the phone not to a half\nGod damn that's what need you to sign\nSharpin to a rapper sell 'em brezzels with the bells\nShe made a quarter mil on the pole singing that\nFish tellin not to major riot on my ass\nMet made Josh riot on the voices\nM&M got a nigga BVS a glass\nMet my main bitch Jay Z Beyonce\nSpending M&M's on with the same lane\nSpending M&M's joining for a rerun\nDope digging your bitch now she again\nYou claim you're hussling when you're more weak for them\nI got a big truck full of OG here\nNeighborhood and OG pay well\nLately those call me sea willy\nI mean the racks in your pocket that's seaweed\nBig bang no doves on pink weed\n\n[Hook:]\nYou a hussler nigga water whipping\nGetting it out the pole\nHow you countin up the mili nigga\nPut it on the road\nShe work for a quarter milly clapping her ass\nSliding down the pole\nShe fucking no million dollar nigga\nHe fucking no million dollar hoe\nNo M&M's\nHis home though more than a million\nWith no M&M's on the low\nDon't fuck with no pee young niggas\nI put those M&M's on the road\nMe and my bitch Jay Z and Beyonce got\nThat ill money is all you owe\nI see them M&M nigga rachel blindfold\n\n[Verse 3:]\nAnd my bitch wear 4 mili\nRatchel we're getting it\nBounce that ass on the pole\nFuck a puppy bayroll\nTough got bank on me mili\nCham my ass out in philly\nLongway blew M&M and mili\nI'm double down with too silly\nJust say I got a D boy discussing\nShe the reason I rerock them chickens\nIn a new air group I fly creeping\nYellow whipping her deuce trying to get the M&M's\nGot the juice while we pour up the money\nJammers got what the young nigga thinking\nWrist game got a nigga like halo\nHey baby look at my bling bling\nTossing with the M&M don't bang bang\nShe keeps on bang bang bang bang\nThese hoes don't always dang dang\nVersace diamonds in the motherfucking pang ring\nThese matches down well with my Hermes\nBought the M&M brrrat brraat gun play\nThrow your gap boy on the runaway\nYou should've seen a nigga air chop foreplay\n\n[Hook:]\nYou a hussler nigga water whipping\nGetting it out the pole\nHow you countin up the mili nigga\nPut it on the road\nShe work for a quarter milly clapping her ass\nSliding down the pole\nShe fucking no million dollar nigga\nHe fucking no million dollar hoe\nNo M&M's\nHis home though more than a million\nWith no M&M's on the low\nDon't fuck with no pee young niggas\nI put those M&M's on the road\nMe and my bitch Jay Z and Beyonce got\nThat ill money is all you owe\nI see them M&M nigga rachel blindfold\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n
