Future)\n\n\n\n[Hook: Future]\nI get high 'til I'm confused\nI don't know what else to do\nBentley Coupe or Porsche Coupe\nHenny got me so confused\nWhite girl black girl I'm confused\nMolly kush I'm leanin on screw\nI'm so geeked up I'm confused\nCash or check I'm too confused\n\nMoney got me too confused\nThese girls they got me too confused\nOxy got me too confused\nI'm too confused I'm too confused\nFuture gucci too confused\nFreeband gang we too consufed\nBricksquad put you on the news\nFree billz got them too confused\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nRobin jeans or switch to Trues\nI don't know, I'm so confused\nHow many girls? Three or two?\nBeat that pussy black and blue\nDamn, I like the way she look\nBut I don't like her attitude\nTook her out and dicked her down\nBut she didn't show no gratitude\nCars, I got a lot of them\nForgiato tennis shoes\nTrapper to the heart\nBut I still'll make a business move\nI cannot go back to jail\nCause I got so much to lose\nDon't leave home without my scale\nCause I got some work to move\nSmash, smash,\nNo cuffin', pass her to the crew\nDid what I did I'm finished with her\nThen I turn her onto you\nDiscombobulated mane\nI swear I don't know what to do\nGucci Mane I'm so confused\nThat I forgot to bring my roof\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Future]\nDrankin' lean and smoking kush\nI'm in the kitchen like a cook\nLean and molly, ecstasy\nI don't know what I done took\nMy black lawyer Abrahaim a Jew\nCash or Visa what I Do\nForeign, foreign, bad, bad\nBitches all the kid pursue\nMy iPad and my Metro\nAnd I'm workin out the iPhone too\nFuture on the super booze\nThe Remy did what I should do\nTurn up with' puff or fuck with' goose\nThe Panamera or my Coupe\nI don't wanna drive no more\nGet chauffeured 'round this fuckin' zoo\nPaper got me a like monster\nTurned me to a fucking bear\nPoppin' bottles on the sofa\nFeel like I'm inside the air\nNo security, gucci down\nFuture plug like everywhere\nFree band gang bricksquad\nFree bandz outta here\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Future & Gucci mane]\n[Future:]\nSolar system on a move\nI Feel like a thousand goons\n[Gucci Mane:]\nMe and Future smokin kush\nWe high as a hot air balloon\n[Future:]\nFuture Jimi Hendrix\nYou might catch the kid eatin' them shrooms\nI'm outer space I'm in there too\nI'm in mars and pluto too\n[Gucci Mane:]\nBricksquad is a army nigga\nPistols for my whole platoon\nIf you ain't gettin' no money then\nYou might aswell leave the room\n[Future:]\nFreebands Freebands Freebands\nWe 'bout to give em hell\n[Gucci Mane:]\nFree pillz free pillz free pillz\nWe got 'em vacuum sealed\n[Future:]\nI be drippin so much sauce\nGot bitches ready to lick it off\nI get so much money man\nI swear I'm geeked up off the sauce\n[Gucci Mane:]\nGucci Mane yeah I'm a boss\nI swear I have to make my point across\nBricks I got to get across\nIn my trap house getting off\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_9445261/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAOecAD2sHb4OsHzN6vXDLEDjESJ_RcExsLS9QN93dTWSvFyQhynU6V2qLymdqUneBXufiKpPTdAHYGS8uVsnJ8pTLRH-XBoFfuJxB5xnI4DPLk7Vt_cdKpRwyxAF2vWzA6PVspvL4lX_A0mlO-snb-Zp3369P1_1wpQTJV_uRc9xTJln-UXxCmjnTpCeD1w8XgI4v8OGGdURVN8R0cwwL7lILztCXXk3kIBQGQsKPgy8wMVLS6TO3_hqxbN7hjZUKaZf3uZNzJ93B5VUyOySeWX2OzEazz1aK8YaEyRMHNgOuRF6v4OE5Rk2LyPvYGOcMUTg0SkoqG9oFbJEv1A2pMkfq8rTF-4eumncxl8jU5oFScSf-kQfSJiQPBkV56Dhd0XBfaLYc80g8R_Dau3jpKLSDpNhL0-IvgDV_BUigf5ShjAesBTkP1X3ofltbSHyS4hSHmKomjE/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"World War 3: Lean\" (2013)\nIntro\nConfused\nExtacy Pill\nBlue Face Rollie\nIts Not A Day\nServin Lean\nWon't Change\nNo More\nDone With Her\nThat Pack\nActivist\nFaces\nDope Show\nBirds Of A Feather\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
