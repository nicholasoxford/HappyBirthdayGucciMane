Big Sean)\n\n\n\n[Verse 1:]\nYou're boyfriends an alcoholic\nBut Gucci is a reefer chiefer\nYou're girlfriends a penis eater\nI swear she's a people pleaser\nI'm pouring up 2 liters\nAnd riding in 2 seaters\nSipping on mojitas\nOne mill on my wife beater\nHoliday season aye\nYou're boyfriends an alcoholic\nBut Gucci is a reefer chiefer\nYou're girlfriends a penis eater\nI swear she's a people pleaser\nI'm born of 2 leaders\nAnd riding in 2 seaters\nSipping on mojitas\nOne mill on my wife beater\n\n[Verse 2:]\nParley with white people,\nReally don't like people\nParty tonight but you must\nGo with the right people\nBigger than life nigga,\nCame with a knife nigga\nAnd if I'm ending his life\nHe found out I'm fucking his wife\nLeave her\n\n[Verse 3:]\nGucci's a custom adept\nSex with no feelings attached\nPuts on my bachelor pad\nPrior the top is detached\nPoppin' and humping and dripping and something\nDamn you're good as one hell of a woman\nYou telling me something, then telling me nothing\nI think about something that keep me from cumming\n\n[Chorus:]\nI brought them racks out to play aye mane\nI brought them racks out today say mane\nI put the racks in your face aye mane\nI brought them racks out to safe say mane\nI brought them racks out to play aye mane\nI brought them racks out today say mane\nI put the racks in your face aye mane\nI brought them racks out to safe say mane\n\n[Verse 4:]\nOK my crib looks like Baywatch\nDon't quit your day job\nShe walking with nothing\nBut she leaving my tank top\nLately I've been seeing\nMore champagne than rain drops\nB.I.G only thing missing is\nPuff saying we can't stop\nRolling with Jigga but\nI'm not a Nets fans\nEverything green around me\nLike I'm a Jets fan\nIf it's green and I burn it\nThis weed and cash I deserve it\nMy car and girl both German\nSaid she Oh I need a surgeon\nI've been running to the money\nAnd it feels like\nI'm racing a turtle, skirt\nBut boy I got rich so early\nI swear I gave my money a curfew\nNow all of you niggas alert you\n'Cause I got the bitch that you cant take\nDrunk of pussy and champagne\nAnd you ain't gonna do a damn thing\n\n[Chorus:]\nI brought them racks out to play aye mane\nI brought them racks out today say mane\nI put the racks in your face aye mane\nI brought them racks out to safe say mane\nI brought them racks out to play aye mane\nI brought them racks out today say mane\nI put the racks in your face aye mane\nI brought them racks out to safe say mane\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_10087527/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAN42zy9K9gFaWSsT3Vgd2alpUGWnSa2IVcF3nCgxora8l04aFpvyy3-6wq4wgjrntxiMs5tYKWibsrgjt28zgGMreTodk6tIoFCTUBj2BzA_ZTsaXD3uiRMMzPn7erlWy0YmZWlufwlLpJLHJGX3OQAyv2nbcVwCOGW2I0PnqL6EvzU9cBfGuVQgdvuH3Ck7MJivpMolL2eAnY3NtQ4YWQxY5CiU-Ck6pLX_U08TPEHHvbcegxlLz8e9SHZAOFlkUXhumR6DfRj7M-kYCj5zLAMsootlSauAMOyak4XwGutkSfYqZtwoD1vMKdNUsBGe8DTrgbbHbkfBwmzMdMW0el8Jou_0VGL3LCdnQ6foYblTqcYwtY2EeAQqtwEgs-LzAopGsVN7m3LFRoapDmDNK_uYPsH1OlKUaXiucqiUESu5KG9-T6G_nihxNFBGlgIl4AtlReZn7_djmDoD4aFfSTAUVbmWI4s/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\nThanks to Joe, yell for correcting these lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"I'm Up\" (2012)\nWithout Me\nI'm Up\nTrap Boomin'\nCyeah\nKansas\nWish You Would\nBrought Out Them Racks\nSpread The Word\nDrink Mud\nAnytime You Ready\nDon't Make No Sense\nSuper Cocky\nGymnast\nScarface\nCareless And Reckless\nGet Lost\nIt Ain't Funny\nPlain Jane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
