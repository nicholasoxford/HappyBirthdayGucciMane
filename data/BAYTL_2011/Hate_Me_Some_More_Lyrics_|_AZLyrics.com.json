Ziggy!\n\n[Gucci Mane:]\nWell my trap house be bunking hard all the time\nMoney sticking out my pockets like a porcupine\nI hope this cocaina cross the borderline\nI made a million dollars just with this lil fork of mine\nI'm in the kitchen whippin deuces up like half the time\nThe other half the time I'm busy somewhere on the grind\nIn Econo Lodge, I've been here trappin' nine days\nDon't give a fuck about what they say, my nigga: crime pays\nGucci! Twenty thousand in singles but I tossed it\nI used to have a top but then I lost it\nI used to have a conscience but I lost it\nI boss so hard that I'm exhausted! It's Gucci!\n\nMore, more\nHate me some fuckin more!\nI love it when you hate me\nIt make my money grow\n\n[V-Nasty:]\nWhere my money? I think it's on that new shit\nOn my fucking block I ain't never gotta prove shit\nEvery time you see me, you know I'm rocking new shit\nI got a new whip off of a new bitch\nShit I do this, you know what the truth is\nBitch ain't like me cause I'm cocky and I'm ruthless\nThe bitch is bummy, no money, she is useless\nI got them fuckin choppers that'll really go through shit\nHold up, I'm way better than the average\nIn my city, I ain't nothing but a savage\nSo many cars, garage look like traffic\nWhen I pull my whips out, you know I'm causing damage\n\nMore, more\nHate me some fuckin more!\nI love it when you hate me\nIt make my money grow\n\n[Gucci Mane:]\nI'm a quarterback, I take a quarter out\nAnd but a quarter back and help harvest that\nIt's that ice attack when I rob my chain\nWhen the girls see me, catch a heart attack\nTold her scrubbin, that's a well-known fact\nBack to back in rraris, what you know about that? \nKill the ho, where your hoes at?\nNigga, beef with me, now how smart was that?\nI'm goin in like a curfew\nLike yesterday you old news\nIn the studio with chrome tools\nNo engineers, them pistols\nI should walk around with toilet tissue\nTil the end time bring [?]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_7687791/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAAE1Y40rG48vLHB5Murb1v3QjRPFSYQluC9EQobaqjZo1WdVNvYn6k0WpXaTorsvhq1P93uTPuaLhmiUHuWEoVOXxhxWj61AKsVMEFg5zgqJYe8r29NJpV56Gv4zbJMW9fo0wtGh9-TPX8JGM1yI0wsXBHNVCkYGaNXG6j6NBzPQWcoV5u4xzQX0txUCczanEkMm12QNP6jkE9852Jut1Zf1Px2TUG6kZawWAoCt9mQZ2t4Q3U7iBzEWdibbOkCKBChMOuMRcWSoocsp_ceY0GkpIGor1fIBbmdG7OKCkliUfGc9mimQYyFmMWvKZ_fVgqnNHd2SyQJlA1fd5xHCdb79a44wSdc5QJXC8FIhvxqa3Z1mBhKGwawyOiKrXDKIN4Djb3dhG1Sp9SKhelEr2KTBAO7uC09JzGMt4d_v5Pc67sTFGPS3qcF2sg2VbKnmL3vV-yqCzJNI-TvaKIwFosLGPLQ/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Vanessa Reece, Xavier Dotson, Radric Davis\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"BAYTL\" (2011)\nWhip Appeal\nLoaded\nLet's Get Faded\nWhite Girl\nPush Ups\nOut My Circle\nHate Me Some More\nMillions Every Month\nFuck You\nSlick Swag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
