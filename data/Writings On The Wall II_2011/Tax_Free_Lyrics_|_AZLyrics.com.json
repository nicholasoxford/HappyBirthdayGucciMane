Ay!\n\nTax free, tax free\nYou get your income tax back, call me\nI got dope nigga, you better call me\nI need all mine\nAll tax free\nI beat the dope up\nLike a step-child\nYeah, the dope's stepped on\nLike a step-child\nTake a step back\nOff the reptile\nYellow crocodile with a gold smile\nI move the dope twice, like a kindergartner\nBig bag of collard greens\nLike I'm the gardener\nThat Drumma Boy on the track\nRun and tell em that\nGive this to DJ Drama, tell him\nI say run it back\nDon't try running off on me\nCause I'mma get you back\nYou know EA, don't know how to act\nI'm taking hits, I\"m talking shit\nI coach the Squad, I make em blitz\n\nI robbed the connect and ain't been broke since\nIt's the return of Mr. Zone 6\nI'm talking shit. Cash shit\nI got them bricks\nIt's the return of Mr. Zone 6, I hit a lick\n\nTax me? Tax me? Nigga\nYou can't tax me, I get it dirt cheap\nTax me? Tax me? Nigga\nYou can't tax me, I get it dirt cheap\nYou know me, shipping OG\nI know the middleman, but he don't know me\nTrophies in my car garage\nI brought? for all my fuckin entourage\nThat murder charge? I beat that!\nThat pistol charge? I defeat that\nAssult with poolstick\nSay I commit that\nThey label me \"convict\" I don't accept that\nStep back like a step-child\nThe dope's stepped on\nMy hood the X Files\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/DFd9gOgOCmSkm2rJwzJTH0h7MhmH9tbW/24pKHf8q53RR2n8vE0b0h4eyM+2npkkedcgqcCJRqS4JqCZdim0I0UIPD9sjLz+jw0h2a2hSLXlCJt9G8wR2nHjqVb+yG3QvgWBZ3VYhX1bqUk1UAyQtlGHOlGLdPfhr2yuHrLLPqM=/?artist_name=Gucci+Mane&track_name=Tax+Free&s=db6717411e64aa8417809f6e77d04e3a\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Writings On The Wall II\" (2011)\nTragedy\nHard On A Bitch\nCamera Ready\nSupa Cold\nTax Free\nScotty\nPlay Your Cards\nGuilty\nTwo Dope Boys\nToo Turnt Up\nMVP\nMAjor\nRecently\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
