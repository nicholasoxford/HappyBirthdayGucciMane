YC)\n\n\n\r\nRound here you play the cards that you were dealt\nI could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel\nI can't see you in my rearview cause you left\nI'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt\n\nRound here you play the cards that you were dealt\nI could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel\nI can't see you in my rearview cause you left\nI'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt\n\nI'm on my hustle, I'm bout my grind\nI got a plan to make the whole Atlanta mine\nOne for the money, two for the show\nThree dollars for the soda, I mix it in the coke\nI'm icy in the summer, I think I need a coat (burr)\nI'll drag you to the river then throw you off the boat\nCold dirty shame, low down dirty games, I use to have them thangs\nBut now I'm on the screen\nPlay it how it go, take it how it come\nFuck how you feel cause my feelings numb\nPlay it how it go, take it how it come\nFuck how you feel cause my feelings numb\n\nRound here you play the cards that you were dealt\nI could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel\nI can't see you in my rearview cause you left\nI'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt\n\nRound here you play the cards that you were dealt\nI could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel\nI can't see you in my rearview cause you left\nI'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt\n\nGucci mane I'm hard to kill\nAin't nobody murkin me\nNiggas think they hercules, have they ass in surgery\nManical, see all these purses, ain't nobody hard as me\nHe may have more money but he'll neva have more heart than me\nIts big dog, bulldog, leapfrog, jumpoff\nSawed off pump, nigga this ain't what you want\nAnd we goin all out, all out for the yola\nI owe it to the soda\nI cut the music down just so I can hear the motor\nI open up the sun roof so you can smell the odor\nPlay your cards right or they'll find you in Dakota\nSuckers get trampled, snitches ran over, snitches ran over\n\nRound here you play the cards that you were dealt\nI could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel\nI can't see you in my rearview cause you left\nI'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt\n\nRound here you play the cards that you were dealt\nI could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel\nI can't see you in my rearview cause you left\nI'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt\n\nRound here you play the cards that you were dealt\nI could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel\nI can't see you in my rearview cause you left\nI'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt\n\nRound here you play the cards that you were dealt\nI could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel\nI can't see you in my rearview cause you left\nI'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/DFd9gOgOCmSkm2rJwzJTH0h7MhmH9tbW/24pKHf8q53RR2n8vE0b0h4eyM+2npkkedcgqcCJRqS4JqCZdim0I0UIPD9sjLz+jw0h2a2hSLXlCJt9G8wR2nHjqVb+yG3QvgWBZ3VYhX1bqUk1UAyQtlGHOlGLdPfhr2yuHrLLPqM=/?artist_name=Gucci+Mane&track_name=Play+Your+Cards&s=a3b2a908af5bb0023a26796384c8f045\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\nThanks to Kyra for adding these lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Writings On The Wall II\" (2011)\nTragedy\nHard On A Bitch\nCamera Ready\nSupa Cold\nTax Free\nScotty\nPlay Your Cards\nGuilty\nTwo Dope Boys\nToo Turnt Up\nMVP\nMAjor\nRecently\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
