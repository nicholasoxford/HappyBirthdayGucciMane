Young Buck)\n\n\n\n[Intro:]\nHoliday season!\n\nRicky Racks I See You!\n\n[Gucci Mane:]\nIf being filthy rich is a crime\nI guess I'm guilty bitch\nI guess I'm guilty bitch\nI killed the rap and last night\nI pleaded self-defense\nI guess I'm guilty bitch\nI guess I'm guilty bitch\n\nThese suckas talking nonsense\nI killed your homeboy\nCause I don't have a conscience\nI'm strapped like Bronson\nBrick Squad, Trap House, beat bunking\nI'm wild like Tarzan\nI'm swinging through the Zone 6\nIn Ferraris. It's on again\nI go to win, strap-for-strap\nI go rap for rap, I rep the trap\nRefuse the death but game to slap\nMy phone is tapped\nI'm off the wall and off the scale\nCame out of jail like\nA bat out of hell\nI refuse to pay up, gotta salute the myth\nGot Clientele, I might as well\nI'm moving weight from state-to-state\nI gots to get my aconchelet [?]\nI know the feds be watching me\nBut there ain't no way they stopping me\n\nIf being filthy rich is a crime\nI guess I'm guilty bitch\nI guess I'm guilty bitch\nI killed the rap and last night\nI pleaded self-defense\nI guess I'm guilty bitch\nI guess I'm guilty bitch\n\n[Young Buck:]\nDrop a pack off to my lawyer\nTake these charges, overturn em\nRoll the kush in my trial papers\nAnd burn em - I'm not going\nThe fork in it and my Glock showing\nIf it don't shine then it's not glowing\nAin't mine if it's not foreign\nBroke ho - bitch you not knowing!\nThey was rap touring I was behind the bus\nWith packs for em\nDidn't plan on digging this up\nBut I need a shovel\nGood looking, Gucci got me back\nI'm trying to buy another\nPounds of mid and my college bitch's\nHouse neighbors complaining about the smell\nThey got her kicked out\nThey popping down to the last pill\nIn Cashville\nI'm getting it fast still, on the real\nI feel it\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_14027952/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAJKx6LTgBgdcC3CFvIfTFqBy_u5Ag89M_DK5FYGXFqR8z2TE3KrYN_lcOUV7AbV4A52Sx4zDSOdcDmmxbvnowV6Ct8MCMhzakMGYQDlRs9G54GIeVP2xM1xMXadA_9QKZGZN160S24wBpuYMDcuAHBPTx5wrbNbsVYmVmmanireAIZOUDD-RaMzFCKHo9JBVB7jJgy_OIbJHHw4DlY2uucoWKbF3fvsmXOScsBDCb9BHFQLHImdlj_KoELkPRpcLDtTVQW-jfB0V4IzOFmY9GwEpsTlucDGlC42wWYrrzGSRMblwclsvK9BO2xMhiALN-PIoQVVEF2g7VVtBUEdnPpQ5sMNre9k9ENF-HneUfN0hZ2N66qrI42ey27LiM7op38PGlZBAX8dYLoq8QwZyI_dBwvEvYTsaj6PLtu3adft2xqhHRAZYW1N2GAwqh6l8_LzL1UpHQKLnRVA/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Writings On The Wall II\" (2011)\nTragedy\nHard On A Bitch\nCamera Ready\nSupa Cold\nTax Free\nScotty\nPlay Your Cards\nGuilty\nTwo Dope Boys\nToo Turnt Up\nMVP\nMAjor\nRecently\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
