Free my nigga Zoe\n40K for a show. Practice what I preach\nShawty Mane that's all I know\nTriple cup styrofoam's got me walking slow\nI'm smoking on reefer, me Gucci and Wiz Khalifa\n\n[Hook - Gucci Mane]\nSmoking on reefer, make a bitch out\nAnd leave her. Comment trough a speaker\nGrind in my 2-seater\nCause I got a fleet-a\nSend em work like it ain't a leak-a\nI practice what I preach-a\nIf you ain't got a game, I could teach ya\n\n[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]\nI got a murder charge now for the tracks I murdered\nLike a nigga turned around, I'm going back to work\nGot a smirk on my face cause I smoke the purp\nGucci boy, now they doing a search\nAnd I ain't been lame, but tame your dame\nCause you should be ashamed how she's off the chain\nI'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussain\nI got a brink of extra change of this extra 'caine\nIt's crazy, Dwayne just counting strange\nMe and Waka Flocka Flame on a private plane\nWith 2 bad ass bitches, bout to run a train\nLike an organ donor, baby loan the brain\n\n[Hook - Gucci Mane]\nSmoking on reefer, make a bitch out\nAnd leave her. [?] speaker\nGrind in my 2-seater\nCause I got a fleet-a\nSend em work like it ain't a leak-a\nI practice what I preach-a\nIf you ain't got a game, I could teach ya\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_19734883/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAJwNB_jU2T-m0ZzXtAG9bjlETaLhqLankFPRR54qtHbu-PG__hiG_O6VEoZ5OIe2rAEGK8sOeJvN4ZAw0LZJuGLd1MQYF-6KlM2tKwCzmtrcP0Db5n1mDaBFfv7F-EBwxU2IHakY5xEdP-Rz_93ANpU4tmkNJ8Wdq6x6r4qbu9jFltaSrqfwQ3Mbe0w1jIGWtu058eFIcc2cXztv8GKeOpxAvtBk6rz90yTOmnY1_ZbpHxd9bnIvtRU8wWFlHlJypyxUMPfxVzMpYOpasydmjJIKyXJB8kMCH2y79Y5jJSAunmrr5DE7zIMjyoT1C35IBya58ueAk3n75D7MZwkFX7Cz3mD5MA7-z7oWDMlPZ5ff2YFns0MGmjxq0h_nYc01vcorhaWMESHiUX6cdYQ0V7mIqUbcwBD7h7EwcOkYpbkaeDUvMQGsB05mOZ0HItWu6w2srmS93c7KFDdkg7KngnDOjg/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Juaquin Malphurs, Robert Lyle, Ladamon Douglas, Radric Delantic Davis\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"Ferrari Boyz\" (2011)\nFerrari Boyz\n15th And The 1st\nBreak Her\nFeed Me\nMud Musik\nIn My Business\nYoung Niggas\nSuicide Homicide\nPacMan\nStoned\nShe Be Puttin' On\nSo Many Things\nToo Loyal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
