You lyin\nYou tryin and lyin, you boys ain't supplyin\nI pitch like Nolan Ryan, got cocallina flyin\nMy partners stick up kids, duct tape rope they gon' tie in\nIn the bushes they lyed in all night that's my word\nBy the end of the mornin they left with them birds\nAnd I'm gone off that purp', and I'm slurrin my words\nI swerved in my Benz, bangin my 4G's on the curb\nThe lean, the herb, pay me like the first\nYou cross Brick Squad, get hurt\nI got work - Gucci\n\n[Chorus]\nMy homeboys will get you, pay you on the 33rd\nTwo pints of lean'll have me slurrin on my words\nUndertaker car, triple black drop bird\nStomach full of money, so hundreds I'ma burp\nAll the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st\nTwo pints of lean'll have me slurrin on my words\nUndertaker car, triple black drop bird\nStomach full of money, so hundreds I'ma burp\nAll the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st\n\n[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]\nFive grand for a head shot\nBoy don't be no Flintstone and get yo' (Bedrocked), nigga!\nTriple red drop, offsets through the parkin lot\nWhere I'm from, young niggaz shootin at the cops\nWhere I'm from, they fakin\nMy hood right side, nigga, green flaggin\nLay yo' ass down if you do too much braggin\nThree case, four Glocks, nigga that's swaggin, ughh\nPenalized, then goes the Packer-Man\nWhat'cha hell, you would think it was a cracker-man\nI don't know 'em bah-bah-bah-bah-back'em man\nFuck 'em den! Throw my stash in the club that there'll do\nEvery girl gettin past you\nSend an ambulance on that ass I want that rent due\nRobbin every nigga that ain't Hit Squad, Blood or Piru\nFLOCKA!!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: YG Hootie]\nHalf a million dollar jewelry like \"Fuck that bird!\"\nNiggaz screamin they want beef, I'm like (Roger That)!\nMy album didn't sell, so I'm layin niggaz down\nShootin every nigga, that burst leaves a fuckin frown\nForty carats on my bracelet, my Polo black\nNiggaz talkin like they want beef, I'm wantin that\nSeven grams in the Swisher, I'm gon' solo that\nRidin around with my strap like \"Where they at?\"\nAll these rap niggaz hold up, stole my Philly hat\nYou will never be a legend like the Gucci Mane\nYou will never be turnt up like my partner Flock'\nYou niggaz hoes I run your block when them choppers chop\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_7768617/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAPXmFoenlG8eQF6C2bPOItR2Jp_C4Kg6mt4WmOi5QGLnemEnVCom8TjpkxUEW9_WQA2A-VXdYB5Lne6aOMGnU3QhYpGzoJQMc9IHJC8XUXsfeTfup9NC-hIWWmLGwJd-8N_7AKsHGaxcjDiUvNOhEoBdnRljqAlxhVYN7qUsJFTSlshbaefP2adJ9te-Tcra8yccEIjcM0gjekSPOxWrYVD-Ssg2YQbPAu9X_KZNrGyPtahgpt2LwjSBlvb-zdGS0HUBUUoSM0vOVLM16KS9vt12a5W78s6ZomEYOGD7pQnhgIddFOssUSH_bJicB-hfgZbl8NXn0y5mMJEeWG6LFclLas2Tn4guR9RaV9p3knfKkPnW9vpU1AMdyvNq7ekthAoOTxItznfM2FmzJozv5kF-KSzYB7xFAXsGQRnyndmQ8kJ_ufl0489jCW2Zoedjre0Hd2leZsZ1_yQk_OzPMv3vEiIYpPZggvHzzPk_sbql/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Davis Radric Delantic\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"Ferrari Boyz\" (2011)\nFerrari Boyz\n15th And The 1st\nBreak Her\nFeed Me\nMud Musik\nIn My Business\nYoung Niggas\nSuicide Homicide\nPacMan\nStoned\nShe Be Puttin' On\nSo Many Things\nToo Loyal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
