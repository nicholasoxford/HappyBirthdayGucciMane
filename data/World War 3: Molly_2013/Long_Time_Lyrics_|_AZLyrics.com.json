I ain't never goin' broke, Early in the morning on the stove,\nWrist spinnin' like a hurricane,\nIce chain came from Johnny Dang,\nReal heavy on my neck I need a cane,\nAll white bitch cocaine,\nI'm whippin' that birdy, with none of that whitney\nThat Brittney come with a free chicken, I live it,\n\n[Hook: x2]\nI was broke down on my knee,\nTook me a long time to get it,\n80 peas, straight gas,\nI done graduated from midgets,\nSkurrtt Skurrtt Skurrtt, pull up throwin money out my ceiling,\nYoung Rich Nigga, fuck it, yeah, different life I'm livin'\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8396923/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCADSx4IkuH6JhcR3-1nuvcWgSieD-r03m7QpE-h5VLtmQENyZivuV2IRx6ryqm9lz5EtS418HJQF0fiRTFqQtvl6o0a-vMpCT8MKVjst0Dxq8PTsuaiJW5oQ-fA9mq5KgsNd4k8q0wL1Fl_keA7XYSSH2FTxAHVFlZfkjI5aL5mrGYtLBLo3596hHMVcU-iJ9_TwI3BJ83fOxouXFljS_0vtbNaMI0tfzl0W6T2Y1V51xN_ff89PGwONg1fUFV7tzRzg-yjJPXIkdnTHMoxdZcGrN9lRwwxC50DjFTyIAPGZBqtEeF_r9EDnpCAGZazc3Ggqb9A_E1A85kV8i8UBiT8PrdROW6_YT0o17_EXC_FSwbVm7BrfX4aUKe0HpAV_FAKCnh9lByAQ8MqITNoRoqZ76mZZQdMaVRfAYpaDOQBoNJmv8UQpH_873lKekRQRVATHDEdPSBlzTULqY4iG4qFM/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Ball Kirshnik, Marshall Quavious Keyate, Yancy Rodriquez Dejuan\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"World War 3: Molly\" (2013)\nYou A Drug\nNasty\nSo Much Money\nLong Time\nPocket Full Of Money\nDon't Look At Me\nPressure\nA To Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
