All my dope is whippable\nAll my bricks are flippable, so extra grams are tippable\nMy living room the chicken room, my bedroom is the treasury\nI'm whippin dope excessively, I pick my trap selectively\nHe peekin' in the kitchen, so I feel he disrespectin' me\nI'm pushin' man, but sellin' dope has always been my legacy\nSeven apartments, double my garment, all the junkies beggin' me\nPills and pints and ecstasy, I need a secretarity\nDamn, I said it wrong, but fuck it, I'm a celebrity\nI'm re-rockin' squares, a hundred thousand profit regularly\nSo let me get this straight, I'm tryna hear this shit you tellin' me\nYou can't price this dope I'm sellin' unless you dumb niggas that's mailin' me\n\nWhippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'\nWoke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'\nWoke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches\nWoke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'\nWhippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'\nWoke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'\nWoke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches\nScreamin' \"money over bitches\" and I started mad whippin'\nWhippin'\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/DFd9gOgOCmSkm2rJwzJTH0h7MhmH9tbW/24pKHf8q53RR2n8vE0b0h4eyM+2npkkedcgqcCJRqS4JqCZdim0I0UIPD9sjLz+jw0h2a2hSLXlCJt9G8wR2nHjqVb+yG3QvgWBZ3VYhX1bqUk1UAyQtlGHOlGLdPfhr2yuHrLLPqM=/?artist_name=Gucci+Mane&track_name=Whippin%27&s=d8c3ce6f1cf84a14645105427932643f\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"World War 3: Gas\" (2013)\nOne Minute\nCant Walk\nGeekin\nWhippin'\nFresh As A Bitch\nLights Off\nChristmas Tree\nDrummaguwopuhhh\nBad Bitch\nRainbow Colors\nTrap God Trap God\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
