(Me)\nCEO, so who I'm signed to? (Me)\nWhen I got beef man who I run to? (Me)\nShe live with you but why she ridin with (me)?\nBags of kush, who my weed man? (Me)\nGet T's, BT's, man who my lean man? (Me)\nSomewhere jury I got a million on (Me)\nVersace diamonds these hoes keep kissin on (Me)\n\n[Verse 1:]\nYellow diamond dripped in piss and say I rap explicit\nIn the kitchen whippin, doing additions, I'm my own assistant\nI have a lick so low cuffed on myself that I took me the lean\nIf you ain't getting no money with me then what you doin with me?\n\n[Hook:]\nMe, me\nI only think of me\nHoes say that I'm conceded 'cause it ain't no we\nI book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me\nI cop the dope then front the dope, then me come shop with me\nOn the TV watchin me\nIn a Bentley listen to me\nI'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me\nI'm on go, no soon for lean\nI'm so turned up, just me\nYou hatin on me and I'm hatin on you\nWatchin you, watchin me\nIs she cheatin on you? is she cheatin on me?\n\n[Verse 2:]\nNeh give me give me lean\nYea the bitch think it's in it\nFuckin then suckin me\nPut it on a bitch when the game on me\nAs she put the thing on me, why you put the blame on me?\nIt's a shame on me\nAnd that credit card on E, car on E\nSo you should put a mouth on me\nPut it on freeze as a meat disease\nNow if I make it, you'll do it for me?\nShoppin for you like I'm shoppin for me\nBut I'm trappin for you, but I'm trappin for me\nBoss if a nigga, boy what the fuck mean?\nStruggle for you but she cuddle for me\nBoss of my labor, I'm rappin for me\nAnd where would I be if it wasn't for me\nTony Montana, she wasn't for me\nWasn't for you and she wasn't for me\nI'm lookin to a bitch well now leave it to me\nLookin at me and I'm drub of the week\nRide through the through with the top in the 10\nGucci Gambino, who talkin to me?\nBaby latina, she fine as some jeans\nGucci bilingual, I'm talkin the tea\n\n[Hook:]\nMe, me\nI only think of me\nHoes say that I'm conceded 'cause it ain't no we\nI book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me\nI cop the dope then front the dope, then me come shop with me\nOn the TV watchin me\nIn a Bentley listen to me\nI'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me\nI'm on go, no soon for lean\nI'm so turned up, just me\nYou hatin on me and I'm hatin on you\nWatchin you, watchin me\nIs she cheatin on you? is she cheatin on me?\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI got lean by the PT by I'm servin you\nAnd they should've named Demetrius 'cus all I think about is me\nMTV  that's Me TV\nEdge over your lane but I'm ridin just me\nOne day trillin this damn RV\nWhen the touchdown I'm a fuck the chick to me\nGive it to me, leave it to me\nYou scream, don't want it, it happened to me\nYo girlfriend scorchin ass bitchin on me\nI guess baby girl you could just see me\nGod I'm trippin the Z's, smoking disease\nThese hustlers ain't worth em, I'm happy to leave\nYour uncle in but he'll be coppin for me\n10 bills every week and they throw me the cheese\nSnitch to the post, said you got it from me\nActors go broke, it won't happen to me\nDon't gotta jumble but put out the numbers\nSo much, guess I need another machine\nRappers are fake, wish he a G\nWho I'm on feature? I'm featuring me\nNo need of a manager managing me\nManage the dope and I'm weezing the lane\n\n[Hook:]\nMe, me\nI only think of me\nHoes say that I'm conceded 'cause it ain't no we\nI book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me\nI cop the dope then front the dope, then me come shop with me\nOn the TV watchin me\nIn a Bentley listen to me\nI'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me\nI'm on go, no soon for lean\nI'm so turned up, just me\nYou hatin on me and I'm hatin on you\nWatchin you, watchin me\nIs she cheatin on you? is she cheatin on me?\n\n[Bridge:]\nWho the only one you trust?
