Akon, Young Scooter)\n\n\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nYou funny, used to walk away from me\nSame bitch in my face talking 'bout I ain't had no money\nYou funny, used to walk away from me\nSame bitch in my face talking 'bout I ain't had no money\nDo you recognize me?\nSay do you recognize me?\nSay do you recognize me?\n'Cause now you're all in my face, while I'm splashing all in your face\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nWell remember 1994, [?] man I ain't had shit\nIn '96 the leverage came and I ain't had shit\nUsed to walk outside DeKalb mall broker than a bitch\nWindow shoppin', window shoppin', I ain't have shit\nSold a nick for a dime thought I did some major shit\nBut the end of the day man, I ain't had shit\nMe and [?] hit a lick but guess what, we ain't had shit\nMe and [?] copped some bricks but guess what, we ain't had shit\nMe and OJ at the 508 man we ain't had shit\nHad to give my lunch to me for free cause I ain't had 50 cent\nBought a [?] for Christmas it was the best money I've ever spent\nMade the profit spent it so quick man that I ain't had shit!\n\n[Hook: Akon]\n\n[Verse 2: Young Scooter]\nBlack Migo Gang you better recognize\nSo I thank God everyday I'm still alive\nBring you rappers to my block bet you won't survive\nNiggas snitchin' to the cops they ain't got a dime\nQuarter million worth of watches just to tell the time\nI just left Colombia the streets is mine\nAnd you can get a split nigga for a dime\nAnd everybody rich nigga that I'm around\nAnd I can make the work do the Julio\nI put wings on the bricks and fly 'em to your door\nAll my hoes shitted on me five years ago\nNow I'm shitting on these hoes like a toilet bowl\n\n[Hook: Akon]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8650707/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAIr7Ngo2iXoelKfh16S8TAbwJqerDVk3E0TuwRaJrwMOTojfKo97urtAPIzku9GlnrUwNhj8nwZHutA3K-CGPnIDEcyal7NTFiC2uq1FAc1TOFwhcJ1ZXj3C8lndBbgxu6WXIpLmH1RU_HIyhtW54KPPCMYnSKOF0ln0xbU-mt6GTZC6Ubu7YLqjj7MWorlm2hO5jyDH2289jZyQZrXla7TsdKFhE8320XwM7uOCH1ZscG8RTFLIoGfxE7NgbxLg6rPr-BAtesI9HfuMp2qLTtgE0TKk6-e8d3ZaS-o_uSB7-Hlx69oJwY8HaNuMXVq6gm2anilweZf_vNAhI0v9xvgWlqQnmtkngqozZBWhf8H9Ti6GjixhQ8_T4IDmVc4QFklCxeqLha_YO8N_sMTliBSOpiHHTzpKIlzJ1DgDgh4tvU32YEdXR5MDnQCllb5DzVyl0TARhLdTzBJVvVRmyWduMWw/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): R.
