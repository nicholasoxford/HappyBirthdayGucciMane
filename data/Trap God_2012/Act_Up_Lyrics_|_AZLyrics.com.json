But I ain't fucking 'round\nDon't let 'em get you down\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI got killers on my payroll, moving when I say so\nThese hoes don't really love me, they just love I got a bank roll\nPluggy just keep sending blow\nHe ain't never said no\nHe mixing on the hat they broke\nAnd I can't understand fool\nI'm talkin to you, pussy ass nigga  you'd better listen\nStepped, is that so hard? With that pistol he paid attention\nJump up with them cane, start hittin' cause they were snitchin\nTell the avalanche hey no need to rush cause shorty twistin'\n\n[Hook:]\nI swear they don't want me to succeed\nBut I'm not letting them leave until I stop em from breathing\nAnd I ain't fucking 'round\nDon't let 'em get you down\nMan, it will make a nigga really wanna act up\nCause I'm a do what I'm a do, on my new got electric\nWhat about you?
