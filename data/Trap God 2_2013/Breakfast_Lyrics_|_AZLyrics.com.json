Waka Flocka)\n\n\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\nI smoke weed for breakfast, I drink lean for breakfast\nI take mollies, I take Xanax, I can't eat no breakfast\nHalf a pound for breakfast, two grams of molly, breakfast\nA pint of lean for breakfast and I'm cookin' dope for breakfast\nI smoke weed for breakfast, I drink lean for breakfast\nI take mollies, I take Xanax, I can't eat no breakfast\nHalf a pound for breakfast, two grams of molly, breakfast\nA pint of lean for breakfast, I got collard greens for breakfast\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nBitin' on my lip for breakfast, can't serve that trick unless...\nWe on two different levels, Flock said he just came from Belgium\nMy trap house right off Gresham, I'm so goddamn successful\nShe ate my dick for dinner then she ate my lips for breakfast\nGot a big booty bitch with some nice size titties\nBaby so fine, gotta let her ride with me\nShe the type of bitch gets an F550\nYou the type of bitch can't get one penny\nSmoke 75 blunts in one minute\nI ain't finna eat no Denny's or Wendy's\nI sure ain't broke and I sure ain't friendly\nI don't flash shows if the show got plenty\nIf the show a smorgasbord then I won't get skinny\nPour the lean so dark that it look like Henny\nIt's breakfast time and y'all niggas come get it\nIf you wanna go to war, pussy nigga I'm with it\nI peeped it, you piece of shit\nTry to creep on, nigga, I seen it\nPut a beam on a nigga for treason\nI'll kill a fuck nigga, no reason\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\n\n[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]\nPocket full of mollies, blow them pounds out the window\nDiamond Cuban gold link chain cost a kilo\nGet it fronted by amigo, plus I got a hit single\nMotherfuck these niggas, what the Hell they sayin'?\nCrossed over, still stay 'hood\nSteel top on my Phantom hood\nCan't cook dope but a nigga shoot good\nGot your baby mama walkin' on my hardwood\nOrange juice and five Backwoods for breakfast\n80, 000 dollars on a young nigga necklace\nCan't hit the club if them hoes ain't naked\nWaka Flocka Flame is so damn reckless\nNiggas puttin' bands on they head, just wreck it\nPocket full of hundreds, don't do no debit\nOnly smoke gas, you smoke unleaded\nBrick Squad hittin' lanes, found the exit\nSmoke another pound, my nigga\nWhere the fuck you from? Throw your 'hood up, nigga\nDiamonds in my mouth, can't do golds, my nigga\nShorty be boozed, kicked back on the leather\nKeep it real, chase cheddar\nShe'll fuck for some red-bottoms and a Givenchy sweater\nThat hoe ain't shit  type of bitch that set me up\nPeeWee in the cut with a scrap and a double cup\nShe ain't see him...\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\n\n[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]\nIn the morning I'm still geekin', lickin' Miley Cyrus for breakfast\nThree bad bitches from the Playboy Mansion,\nI'm PeeWee Longway Hefner\nGot pink double-sealed in my refrigerator, I pour mud up for breakfast\nGot a place, said he want a load of collard greens\nMeet me on Metropolitan at the Burger King\nWent out for breakfast, nigga, me and Waka and Gucci\nJust finessed it up, $4, 000 gas, pass in a Bentley truck\nWe eat rats, that's how we get full\nIf you a rat, we got the semi-auto full, boy\nTook your ice in, that shit, I ain't Bird\nCatch a tail from the light I'll come and make this year\n2013 I tip, tryna calm my whip\nRappers talkin' 'bout the table, countin' up my chips\nSippin' on mud, drinkin' out the mug\nWith a nigga misses, boy, I know he pissed\nLean got me trippin', is it workin'? Shit...\nOne day, I ain't gon' hurt you, bitch\nY'all know the rest, it's my breakfast, bitch\nTrust me not, punk, fuck you, shit\nMolly on me, bitch, the lean on me, bitch\nGo ahead all with them hash and grits\n\n[Hook]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8164872/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAPIb3dqV3-s1-V3DmrUSfXztit38C07IA6AFhh01832ho9HF27wG2NGOaSEo_446uvXAmmbbu_p_eaBHhV4qlOaA9djLxBd-S9Otj9egU0gvxr7itg-s1rIgWjTT9hjuQlt-6JJufTUT6ieKc9A7axguDnv9wHPowrwIj3_QJg9wXmNdyu7iZVlwauR3mq1uEkD76ifPxdfTcWNIlbkd6v675BTXJgf_0Wm5fP-xFbWIb5UDnaEP3rLQBXPy5QWbKcq0dding8UnBFCmjd-quqQP15pIEIpmPR8gjFY7yKizCkKJPXSHKz2XqcYz0iyL2KtMP0Vot4JTOJQz15WLkmYrxnCkiI8NGItMVuaX2GjHEBS0H_VK_X9NjnkHOt1RCcao95IItetdhRJa6QQCfl9bIO4NYi0TNYQBByVz2ac2qA-HGP5OW-Gu-ypvL9_LuP3XG8I0-jXI-aSIb0c7irGQK6T3yKaNWRmHTp0K/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap God 2\" (2013)\nIntro\nBig Guwap\nWhen I Was Water Wippin\nNuthin On Ya\nServin\nBullet Wound\nBob Marley\nPistol In The Party\nMiracle\nSquad Car\nRich Muthafucka\nBreakfast\nGreasy\nCan't Interfere Wit My Money\nScholar\nReally Ready\nYou Gon Love Me\nGods Witness\nRunnin Circles\nBreak Dancin\nGet The Doe\nFly Shit\nSupposed 2\n\n\nmixtape: \"Money, Pounds, Ammunition\" (2013)\nPeeWee Longway (Intro)\nJames Bond\nM&M's\nBreakfast\nStarted From Scatch\nDon't Blow My Capsule\nI'm Dealin\nCar Smell\nPresidential\nFreshman\nDress Her\nSpike Lee\nRunnin Round The Lobby\nJohn Dillenger\nJugg Nigga\nForeign Dreams\nKing Pin\nStuff Crust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
