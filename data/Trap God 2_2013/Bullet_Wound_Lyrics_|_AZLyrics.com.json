Lil Wayne & Young Scooter)\n\n\n\n[Intro:]\nGucci Mane the player, millionaire but don't give no care\nTote my pistol anywhere, go to war with a grizzly bear\nBurn your house with your kids in there\nCall the folks how? I have been in there\nAK in my ceiling there - drop top V, 12 cylinders...\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nGucci Mane the player, millionaire but don't give no care\nTote my pistol anywhere, go to war with a grizzly bear\nBurn your house with your kids in there\nCall the folks how? I have been in there\nAK in my ceiling there - drop top V, 12 cylinders\nYour girl never had Christian Louboutins so I bought her a pair\nReally it's not an affair, 'cause she fucked a millionaire\nMack 10 with a cooler, fool\nThese fuck niggas with bullet wounds\nStitchin' hangin out my britches, you can see this from a distance\nI've got Bloods and Crips with 30 clips\nFresh ass nigga with a dirty pistol\nI'm the same nigga that fucked your sister\nYou so broke, can't buy no pistol\nI'll buy your bitch, I'll buy your life\nDon't know when, but your mom'll miss you\nEvery day I'm on driver, nigga - never catch me in neutral\nI ain't doin nothin' in reverse\nWell lose you, nigga, now converse\nSee the concert of my convert\nGot the right plan but the wrong purse\nI've got yellow gold, I've got rose gold\nI've got pink diamonds like Starburst\nI don't rehearse, I don't plan first\nThat nigga strong, hook, I called the right person\n\n[Hook: Lil' Wayne]\nYellow bone, butt naked\nIf the pussy wack, eject it\nMan all my hoes be actin' like detectives\nBut I don't give a fuck, and if I did I would give it to you\nThat rainbow has two colors  rhythm and blues, yeah...\nI just hope for the time, my time's only...\nSay we runnin' out of time, tell that to a time bomb, yeah\nThen she kiss me on my bullet wound\nWho are you? 'Cause motherfucker I'm me\nFuckin' right - and if she say she catchin' that nut, I throw a strike\nI can't believe it's butter, go get my butter knife\nShoot a nigga twice in case he live a double life\nLil Tunechi, yeah...\n\n[Verse 2: Young Scooter]\nShorty pussy wet, the dope drippin' wet\nI live a double life, I got a stupid dumb chick\nI do the shit that rappers do without a rap check\nI shit on hoes and pour up fours, I got street respect\nI'll hit you with that carver, you won't live a double life\nI hit you niggas last week, so I got double strike\nForeign bad bitch and she fuckin' on sight\nI go Hublots, I got Rollies, I got ice on top of ice\n\n[Hook: Lil' Wayne]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8311411/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAB_PpIUH-sha1JkEbf2R-bcfglDfLQUgHyZ0UGAWkHIBpNvx_MFkoNHVHsYmXiBy7gAToo2LJZZbFYDWacHfts7JrApnL323fFHwo7ipcHTtXRTDKyhDqsgswo709vpbtN38ESSFr2d73yUXJd-2LUhcHaD-Wok8QU1VLh4qEjd95hJ9kN6wXBeT3xUHkDSCKEIni0dodB-5-NpR8z9LWAqKyhPxImkux9mcH3UN9MLmW2PabVI4zRyJZaTm5fJouBhfRIENrSo9pJNZRO8vBOYA0lQWHZdr5XOeTqf5Zd95jLEcZlZaPEHQFbAO0n6vhu_l8ydls18yTScNnUtKbbCX5ITKKEqMs1QalDFvoFbb-IBfpAANM4VmtaenvMOQRGPgMprSwH7lOLtrGk37qqMFcqXHorPzIH-tRMt0ePQW6-9YxfYb35IoIGjVpVuU7s2FdXonlrd1k1aCqrQqLKpIgOPEbJHPLRwd7Zk/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Hayward Ivy, Radric Davis\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap God 2\" (2013)\nIntro\nBig Guwap\nWhen I Was Water Wippin\nNuthin On Ya\nServin\nBullet Wound\nBob Marley\nPistol In The Party\nMiracle\nSquad Car\nRich Muthafucka\nBreakfast\nGreasy\nCan't Interfere Wit My Money\nScholar\nReally Ready\nYou Gon Love Me\nGods Witness\nRunnin Circles\nBreak Dancin\nGet The Doe\nFly Shit\nSupposed 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
