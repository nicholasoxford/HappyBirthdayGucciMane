Nigga, I'm upset too\nThey say the yellow jewelry jeweller in the rest room\nOn the top, a nigga'll hit you with a barstool\nYou the type of bitch'll make up, wear a costume\nYou little boys better go and watch some cartoons\n'Cause I'm my own man, nigga, I'm my own goon\nAnd I swear I got a whip game incredible\nGod take my breath now if I'm scared of you\nI'll turn your best friend to a fuckin' vegetable\nBut I'm a stop talkin', I ain't tryna lecture you\nI'm the president, nigga, it's election year\nEA dictator, ain't no reelections here\nSpectator nigga, test that's ahead of you\nBefore I dap you up, boy, I'd rather wet you up\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nAK's, ain't no pistols here\nAnd we gon' wet you up here (oh my God)\nNow it's a motherfuckin' miracle (what bruh?)\nHow I put a hundred bands in one ear\nI've got two-on-two hundred bands in my ear\nWho this nigga here? Standin' mighty close to my rear\nI'm just keepin' it real\nI'll go shoot his ass and his ear, damage my career\nHundred bands make me stand here\nDiamonds come from...\nBitch, I'm just playin', I appear, diamonds crystal clear\nOh, you got them bands? Okay, dear, we gon' milk you here\nMight be broke, I tattoo tears, and no M&Ms\nI'm a throwback boy and a blood, I need them...\nGuwap set up shop anywhere, anytime hoe\nThug'll come with glocks anywhere, any kind hoe\nGreen bells, white bells, oh, that smell, yeah, that smell\nVery rare, we everywhere, you'd never dare, you in a wheelchair\nI'll take that bitch, slut that bitch, fuck that bitch, suck that bitch\nSend that bitch back to you dead broke, she like money, man\nSuck you like a tidnit... give her your paper\nJust to bring it back to me\nShe like when I shine like a glacier\nMy pinky rings are equator\nMy cups is no maper, I meant maple\nApple juice, purple, baby bottles, Gerbel\nI man Gerber, kill shit, murder, sipper\nSlurper, it's a motherfuckin' miracle, I'm lyrical\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8210123/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAJVaof71Kx7u-AEKLGgt6sdh26XO9Rx2OvnFsiFr5xQhyez67HverVTSgvdDL2bivevXw-BZYgZjW6k3KahUnYtgtzKNDZ95gh1yVGxFrS95vBvjFr1JnMzk7UekjY9JTaza7Fox0qg3nXB0LDPW9zKpWOIrwJeEgGIH7Lp4SbTvVU6MwCSrFJN5PdtdYtLyK343Rkja_wZ6e7lxPkoIXeBebit-AoZdaEQjVcl87rnL2Vmj7MIYpGYMUq07RmTB4WFHFKzQ5bqdRztq4Pf_EpW3n0nWfP3T-LSDDJ4edKfqZ-pzfCg9jUBh1BlztU9WfD9WvtCnfOPswlDmZ9Ey53BNcHfCH07GvhM1BFaQ4W1kDMLThj86gpjFDi6pPjafTKdxNYA2MVfsvRZdij59Qtc28BrF21rz5CL4a1SL0zDVZ9DWYRG_fXAGCURuihDbJYxu2IEo94x9Bg/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap God 2\" (2013)\nIntro\nBig Guwap\nWhen I Was Water Wippin\nNuthin On Ya\nServin\nBullet Wound\nBob Marley\nPistol In The Party\nMiracle\nSquad Car\nRich Muthafucka\nBreakfast\nGreasy\nCan't Interfere Wit My Money\nScholar\nReally Ready\nYou Gon Love Me\nGods Witness\nRunnin Circles\nBreak Dancin\nGet The Doe\nFly Shit\nSupposed 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
