Bitch you really tripping\nWhat's wrong with you, what kind of life you living?\nYou wanna ball, hit the mall, or just eat Church's Chicken\nGucci be really pimping, I need just thirty minutes\nAnd if you cool baby we could fuck every Wednesday\nBut you must pay attention, baby you got to listen\nThe first rule, that you cannot have hoes in my business\nYou know I ball relentless, pull up in Benz and Bentley's\nAnd I don't wanna meet your daddy, I ain't fucking friendly\nI had three-hundred-fifty-thousand, I was only twenty\nYour baby daddy broke, I bury his ass in fucking twenties\nYeah I'm a fat nigga, but all I ride is fucking skinny's\nAnd I don't wanna fuck that bitch cause she to fucking skinny\n\n[Hook]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8117144/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAAPj_5X6Nb6k20YY5aDAa29_qm19rMVvsYjNHKQeO2zl_BNhQGrdUerA3l0U8WyEJtNHmNxtC69ob7IO5QCJNN5jnCKdjZLp7AzTOLK7sJR144Ovekv4x-BwuZKRQaJj5ko1kJQgjI5iLC7X1oNyMiOBnhiagG9VbOLBBr5HpkMgbKQa4sgxVpfdOJShnlHMaU11ciJiMV03bIWwYKniP4qxKFmDTZVbiSUYktFmqqwJQrXqlOPzuC4DSLgpd6LhOSSExnA8pAlmJ8WCXRT3oZZaYWa8N5u_JU9Uyi77ei0YM85bdH7AS_06JLK2up4uHM2ExmCJ-oUA4D44BIEcflnHPaH8mGJYW_GAzljjuIdmkMh6WlG_kcOcpvV09C4vhqXV3dECl_ewcivYekja0OgSJmh_61GIlA6L5ohu-YzhGzGR5VugerNXX3mYszrM5DjCwM0RZbY/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap God 2\" (2013)\nIntro\nBig Guwap\nWhen I Was Water Wippin\nNuthin On Ya\nServin\nBullet Wound\nBob Marley\nPistol In The Party\nMiracle\nSquad Car\nRich Muthafucka\nBreakfast\nGreasy\nCan't Interfere Wit My Money\nScholar\nReally Ready\nYou Gon Love Me\nGods Witness\nRunnin Circles\nBreak Dancin\nGet The Doe\nFly Shit\nSupposed 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
