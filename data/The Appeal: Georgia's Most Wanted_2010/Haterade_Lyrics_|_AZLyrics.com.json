Ooo whoa oh, girl...\nI be sippin on haterade (yup!)\nThat deep-down, getcha paid (yup!)\nAnd it taste like lemonade (yup!)\nScrunch your face when you sing it babe (yup!)\nI be sippin on haterade (yup!)\nThat deep-down, getcha paid (yup!)\nThat flavor's lemonade (yup!)\nScrunch your face when you sing it babe, y'knalmtalkinbout?\n\n[Gucci Mane]\nI'm not listenin, I'm not interested\nMy attention only focused on what I get\nAnd I'm glistenin, they call me Mr. Check\nWhite ice lemonade, red ice she thick\nGot a general Phantom, bitch I'm icy and peachy\nSo I treat it real good like hoes is squeezed\nMy life, I ain't ever seen a car like that\nAnd she prolly won't see the next shit I get\nAnd a seventeen fresh, and I say, \"I guess\"\nSuccessful, healthy, I live no stress\nSo today is the day that the big boys shine\nDrop tops everywhere, I wouldn't know how to rock\nGot the titties of today showin off tan lines\nCash bendin in my pockets, no it's not, draw lines\nMe and Skateboard P in the club on time\nNo not on time, but it's just in time\nIt's Gucci!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Nicki Minaj]\n[Sighs] Uhh, yo, aiyyo\nThis one goes out to all of my critics\nDon't you feel stupid? Look how I did it\nLook how it came to pass when I said it\nWe can do debit, I don't need no credit\nYes I'm epic, look how I rep it\nIt's been eight years, but I broke the record\nYup, the record - yup, the record - yup, the record\n(And just for the record)\nUhh, I'm all that I can be\nAnd I'll admit, I'm appalled when you envy\nBecause you can do it too, and you can do it too\nI just happen to be the girl that they do it too\nSo I'ma bounce back, and I'ma ball out\nAnd every time you see me, I'ma go all out\nAnd I'ma win till the endin\nDon't be mad when you see me transcendin\nGuc!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Gucci Mane]\nI ball hard, I should be in Sports Illustrated\nCooler as a muthafucka in a Porschelemonade coupe\nAnd a Ferrari in your hood, you're intimidated\nMutilated, Maserati Lamborghini decapitated\nFed investigation on what I accumulated\nSayin he ain't real, that I'm not the man that I say I am, like I give a damnmuch\nRide around town pickin up stacks\nSome like Louis, some like Gucci\nBut I love money, yeah I love solution\nAnd my teenage karat ring, baby girl choose\nAnd I ain't really hard to please baby come choose (come choose [echoes])\nLounge around, around the town with the top chopped off\nYou can call it lost and found 'cause my top stay down\nAnd I ain't seen a muthafucka since I bought this car\nI ain't seen a muthafucka since I bought the car\nIt's Gucci!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Pharrell] Gon' lift ya glass, gon' liftya glass\n[Gucci] Just think about the future and forget the past\n[Pharrell] Everybody just lift ya glass, gon' lift ya glass\n[Gucci] If a nigga keep hatin, tell him kiss ya ass\n[Pharrell] Just lift ya glass, gon' lift ya glass\n[Gucci] Let's think about the future and forget the past\n[Pharrell] Everybody just lift ya glass, gon' lift ya glass\n[Gucci] That nigga think they goin hard, don't make me laugh - it's Gucci\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_7096830/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAI_GMj4b7g_yGMaSpxnuscSt0-CO1PD5_kVvIpNGJWpS2FIRxbdt9_8sU7nEuS17V-94yEJuqFiHSpmc8SufLebyEqaM_LsVzYDTqms22wb94-blBJufnHZv117yR4dAIsDFksb_laSnXKp7M_Pf6wg4Mf43RyHfwq38n26p5Rj84xHTj9zd-y1_-NAZx562YnDF44fBePZrTUJiEoE6OfCuMrb53V2jRxXliu1qxf8SeVeo-J5peJQSU3E48R_HjkUDauSMyBjHf9lXHuuipaFPkieFVS8kPYT56hCa-ep1DOLGztTpP5mXi8dpsYT5hj3IkD_35ENiruUkY9x2-rR6JaP86-F9rvkZRCCDMfUbYuZMDnO-dlyfjvK92ygL3_Wpm_EJfZZo_jx5MabuuCrj9njhojyL3FuyAU6ZDaKGD7ERMCord4tXy5tXSemc3Oi3qRnOw42ycdoL4Hg8utSmbIE/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Onika Tanya Maraj, Radric Davis, Pharrell L.
