Givenchy\nMy shirt covered in all stars\nAnd y'all wasn't wearing gold watches\n'Til you seen us wearing gold watches\nAnd you may have a hit bitch\nBut this one'll knock the ball park\nAnd oh!... lawnmower, just for the snake boys\nShoot your ass into pieces, man\nAnd deliver it to your front door\nOh! Encore, they want more, they're fans now\nGot your girl ass clapping, hands down\nDon't approach me with your hands out\nSittin' down I still stand out\nTall nigga with jewelry on\nLike Christmas lights on a damn house\nIt's me, and I'm cool with it\nYou don't know what to do with yourself\nWhen I do it, I'm doing it fresh\nBorn to do it, so I do it to death\nCalm in the steps, welcome my dawgs\nWe don't get along, I'm tellin' 'em fetch\nHit 'em like \"PA!\" Hit 'em like \"PA!\"\nShoot up the spot and I'm leavin' like \"Ah!\"\nOkay, you know I started from scratch\nI got to the strip club just to relax\nI get a flat tire, I buy a new car\nYou know what time it is, check the Rolex\n\n[Hook: Gucci]\nIf you keep whining, baby, you gon' lose me\nBetter choose me, baby, come choose me\nSo fine that I let the girl use me\nBut I don't ever get used up, usually (turn up, turn up)\nBaby use, me - baby, use me\nBaby use, me - baby, you can use me\nBaby use, me - you can use me\nBut I don't ever get used up, usually\n... makin' no noise\nThat nigga ain't makin' no noise (nah, nah)\n... makin' no noise\nNo niggas ain't makin' no noise (shut up)\n... makin' no noise\nThem niggas ain't makin' no noise (nah, nah)\n... makin' no noise\nThat nigga ain't makin' no noise (shut up)\n\n[Verse 2: Gucci]\nIf you're an ugly hoe, I can't leave with ya\nIf you're a broke nigga, can't smoke weed with ya\nIf you ain't a boss then I can't sip lean with ya\nI'm not a rapper, bitch, I'm a mob figure\n4-58, it's a centrepiece\nThese hoe niggas ain't seen half a million\nGot a pimp cup, I'm in the strip club\nAnd the difference is these hoes ask for me\nLaFlare, nigga, I'm rare, nigga\nCan't match shit... nigga\nYou a bad nigga? Well I'm a bad killer\nYou a fuck nigga, I don't fuck with ya\n2 Chainz, nigga, my cous-cous\nAll my cousins sell drugs\nMy brother sent a pack, I fell in love\nAnd told everyone I know I sell bud\n\n[Bridge: Gucci]\nAll I rock is designer clothes\nAll I take is designer drugs\nSo geeked up couldn't find the club\nWoke up on the beach with a bag of bud (damn)\n2 Chainz, two times, got major money\nMore money than a label tryna sign a thug\nAin't seein' y'all sayin' y'all wanna sign with me\n'Cause the artists you've got ain't hot enough...\n\n[Hook]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_13619129/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAN35WtBrYlDoLkPwnUwSTgUnAMRrKWYTSAZ5accoVHGQcD8KDxXgYpl7F2TpkhfWumC9j9efDhFTbX2Tl_X-dB0ZRiPgjAQ-ag2nJ5ifW2ToQABul4J_CToawVazABN-p1M3a4fMfER9koXUZjFA6eFBygLmacSV8EgVZnHTmgV8Gz0o7rSbDlky_Xkt5H_KhQObzfO9tlvvzya50YgrloGvo-jnItDBZ-CYw9OIN1hP8uOFBAuDB2mVvn4LV3Crdv-6z7186WsXz6H913fK64gwVtzl4X5Eaum0aeXuY9zVuYXdm2ZcQXokhFHlbrOayPFerDudO7irGh0dU1P3r1hyX8uC2YNYtEDM_XmM1fmDJ8F8kNyRRYJGmWQpuky_XZH2oUD3PFEdpHHhcuKN6cPfj0Ygp9zn7UUgdza0ElZ5jQs8Igk6n0yJd7HsxqN65mxiEpz_7lKwkQ/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Carlton Mays, Radric Davis, Tauheed Epps\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"Trap House III\" (2013)\nTraphouse 3\nUse Me\nNuthin On Ya\nHell Yes\nI Heard\nFuck With Me\nThirsty\nCan't Trust Her\nDarker\nMuddy\nPoint In My Life\nOff The Leash\nNobody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
