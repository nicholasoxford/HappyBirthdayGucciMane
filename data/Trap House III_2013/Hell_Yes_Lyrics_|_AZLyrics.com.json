That's a \"hell no\"\nAm I fresh? Yes, yes\nAnd my bitch dressed, yes, yes\nDress so fresh I impress myself\nAnd I'm smoking on a pound of the realest\nYes or no, am I over dressed?\nAsked for a pick-up, said \"hell yes\"\nAsked for the dick I said \"hell yes\"\n\"Do you wanna fuck me?\"\nShe said \"hell yes\"\n\n[Verse 2:]\nBaby, I'm a go out my way just to please you\nPlease don't leave me now, girl, 'cause I need you\nI'll cut these hoes off right now, I really need to\nAnd I don't even know why, girl, but I believe in you\nYou've been stuck on my line since you laid eyes on me\nAnd I don't like your hatin'-ass friend because she lied\nAnd I just touched down, I made my girl so proud\nI know her inside out, I know her upside down\nAnd plus that girl stay down through all my ups and downs\nEven the thought of losing her...\nSome niggas might say no to drugs\nAll my crew say \"hell yeah\"\nWe don't go get one pill, we got get twelve pills\nAll my niggas got brick fair, all my niggas got brick fair\nAt the faculty game, and your bitch there\nI was worth ten mill' when Vic was here\nAnd the same 'hood you can't come to\nThat's the one, my mama pay rent there\nSpin the globe, every point I've been there\nI went platinum in Australia\n\n[Hook]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8285529/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAGezsu5YzaK_IGjWluHaMwgCrsMZC6DkLi01DTlgQIh726o_62z_8WthfEFMxY7oZWB_I9MCI8Z8vmkmELSKY7NGryu1gMt2j696o71BkUl5SctsSTz0sziYG7haxmQo9F3uT6EB2EASQW1wmnzjKSJP9yv-YfeiYs0X-TnZEmsA5X6RJ5OGXESWA-TvSwDLMN842IzIy7ChZqH0Q3Ija2rAStufzRhp4Oco0_rn5puN3DrXwCBGq12dLiDXW1CdMSNUTOgsIZawe2vzpUhPPdElcYmfMATNJjFzULJVDuA9NUmRlRac_nSsPfBWS4Bd4Xh7DgfR5D5dOaRZ8c50FLz_3sfKbJQ80fwEur488ACAiGioh-wdckpbuP26sVqAfhp9gG5oXmvuOHTQUcUB-IQJajn31nXezohd60WcLetydb9QkspOF86A_Uykfg/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Davis Radric Delantic, Mays Carlton D\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"Trap House III\" (2013)\nTraphouse 3\nUse Me\nNuthin On Ya\nHell Yes\nI Heard\nFuck With Me\nThirsty\nCan't Trust Her\nDarker\nMuddy\nPoint In My Life\nOff The Leash\nNobody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
