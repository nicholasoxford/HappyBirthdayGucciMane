Rich Homie Quan)\n\n\n\n[Intro:]\nSix spots, twelve stoves and I need more pots\nAnd I told [?] that my boys got caught\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nThe junkies say it's finger lickin' how I whip up powder\nI took your food and prada shoes and added me more power\nAnd if you bought some Sour Diesel then your dream gone sour\nI treat your shooters like cowards make your team look sour\nI feed the hood with the bowl like I cook clam chowder\nRIP to Steve McNair that boy right arm was a rifle\nI would race you for the car, but look you don't got the title\nYou ain't made ten mil, I can't call you my rival\nI got your baby mama suckin' on me using saliva\nI made the Forbes list, nigga, man, you just a subscriber\nMy momma say you just a lyin' bitch, conniving lil' diver\nNigga killed his own brother saying, that shit in the bible\nMan, Joe Blow chose the fork, and you chose the screwdriver\nI made another steal a car but I made the cash off a niner\nI went so hard I make you dump your whole roster to sign me\nAnd you can find me in the six with all my shooters behind me\n\n[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]\nI'm a say a prayer, get a blessing today (amen)\nNo grey hair I ain't stressin' the case\nMake you scratch for the chase, I invested in yay\nMan what else can I say? I'm still gon' flex in they face\nWhat the fuck can I say? I got racks in the safe\nGet wrong that gat on my waist, that house they trap in that place\nLeaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say\nNever forget where I came, and it's all 'cause I'm having my way\n\n[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]\nThat right to, I'm having my way\nBy the bay, I move, penthouse by the lake\nThey cool my neighbors, got a gate so you know them folks safe\nGot a pool, twelve acres and a guest house if you wanna stay\nMan I'm cool, gettin' paper, and a custom Cartier\nI'm a smooth operator, I gotta customer named Shade'\nAnd she'll bug a motherfucker all day, then try to pull up in all grey\nI ain't gon' play with you, I'm impatient too, ain't gon' wait for you\nI'm pimpin' like players do, Lean match the gator shoes, the windbreaker hater proof\nYou lookin' nervous, Gerber, soft like baby food\nOk cool, I got a plug like no other\nNo discussion me and Thugger, Waiting on judgement\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]\nOh, Never forget where I came\nAnd it's all 'cause I'm having my way\nOh, Never forget where I came\nAnd it's all 'cause I'm having my way\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_9641967/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAAINl-5sWSxYhgK2rHg9kQuI-3TwhetkT_-haqGi7byOOZVrD2Y4-mPoNSrwndVwOL1BJW9edmbyYE_VdxTQc-5HGFjoe7HIp7oHkQRrQpNZ38mWlSOOBuYM0_D9EmvIWoIq8AYzzx86_MLjsaIjNX553RvlYZ9Y_UxwLpwQUyC7up2ZjHY6jjLUSJIYVWD4mCJCpyAue2Q-w3Tx7K75Kd9R79VRLKtJOmZnZ1PdTiU-O6gezEP9j9yDHK-U1HAJCvgIMaZblQVofI0CWQny3idsIk6aZLZmROReJGYTYWxPhPaZ8qMiXUHja2DhImX3ZERj15azKlaBa-r_e7MTKwqvszsM-pdaZnBQ9LThSdtxfHpdah0orO1spSbNSl08SBt4XxOD4IlsDvY_uKxcPJnlzqtvgTjowJD5RKWtre4iXicfI2mUCJJiqXgioYuf9bDlWSuUqAqrf2H6kx2txQjav0pVUg/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Brick Factory: Volume One\" (2014)\nCash Shit\nAight\nOn Us\nPaper Problems\nMy Customer\nReal Gas\nSay A Prayer\nServe On\nNo Love\nPour Some More\nTexas Margarita\nBring It On\nHomeboys\nLove Somebody\nNWA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
