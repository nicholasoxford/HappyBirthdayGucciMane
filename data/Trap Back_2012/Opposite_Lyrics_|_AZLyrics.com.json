I think so\n\nYou niggers think the same I think the opposite\nPut my trunk in the front that's the opposite\nAlright, good spread the paint her chocolate\nSteering wheel on the side that's the opposite\nGucci Mane south side thinking opposite\nLittle stack in cabins but I'm smoking broccoli\nYou gon pay or eat the box on the opposite\nI-I-I'm a record cut her off that's the opposite\n\nI was locked up no sun shine\nNow I'm out and I'm balling too hard\nGot two scrubs no bigger\nMy jury game is retard\nLike a six shot I'm fully loaded\nAt Magic city I'm getting loaded\nSmoke so many blunts with your girlfriend\nI thought that her head exploded\nIt's gooey wap and then new drop\nI got 4 O's in my soda pop\nSo faded I'm so wasted\nI thought that I had dread locks\nMaking money at a fast pace\nDon't come out here cause it ain't safe\nRoll orange and I drink grape\nI can't feel my damns face\n\nYou niggers think the same I think the opposite\nPut my trunk in the front that's the opposite\nAlright, good spread the paint her chocolate\nSteering wheel on the side that's the opposite\nGucci Mane south side thinking opposite\nLittle stack in cabins but I'm smoking broccoli\nYou gon pay or eat the box on the opposite\nI-I-I'm a record cut her off that's the opposite\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_7529336/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCANlRFLmwb2SUfOHFBSmu19zq_rFi4ZO0s6eH4oN3LhGVuLIJuvXXKYl194S9xKAUgErBXZhTWa_IpJHR6xuO5jSgHvXtSuZCtTSfqUFHi2fwRWsF9KVGnBvgQwhfZQStnW8v1Rcl34tYLoyASMb5P49BRMNeOShvQgNIiZA1JcDiudR3l-Faurr0flfnLdM49pgT6gEpPZ9VWRKVeBMFJpkAG6MfJ8iLbTlzQ3NUdpqKIw6uBlelE-QQ2Dv_gPJcln4R-XtOqnYfoRaUdMq_Ih_70kzAwGHZVXXDixU2nHOKIKKWhrBW_ajR1y1wuLFlYqKR4Xz8fYJrfTC2sS9WCkcodG87fe3QpChUdbiplemXPO9N0AyBlAGIOhv4_ASTfD6kIddPTVzhj0ZVo815KCYx5bkZrBqOVokqK7yLCBgtK24YxkqxwwKKxQ/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Radric Davis, Joshua Luellen\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap Back\" (2012)\nBig Boss Meech Speaks (Intro)\nBack In 95\nQuiet\nWalking Lick\nPlain Jane\nGet It Back\nTrapBack\nOpposite\nBrick Fair\nGhetto\nThank You\nFace Card\nIn Love With A White Girl\nChicken Room\nOkay With Me\nClub Hoppin\nSometimes\nNorth Pole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
