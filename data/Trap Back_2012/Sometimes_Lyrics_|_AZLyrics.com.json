Future)\n\n\n\n[Gucci]\nI know God can't be mad at me\nBecause all the blessing he gave me!\nRiding around with my top down Im looking up at the galaxy (stars)\nA lot of girls cant stand me, They dont really understand me\nCant get half of my Phantom, Cant get half of my mansion\nLost my homie to gunfire, Nigga part of my empire\nEver since that day Ive been arriving late like a vampire\nPeople say Im a addict, got a lot of bad habits (true)\nI love smoking that broccoli, & i love stacking that cabbage\nShout out to my jeweler, Damn he's such a good jeweler\nShout out to my shooter, Damn hes such a good shooter\nEvery car that I ride, Clean from bumper to bumper\nEvery time that I slide, Throw my top in the dumpster\nIm OG, yous a youngster, Got more guns then contra\nMore chains then Buster, & More hoes then Usher\nIts Gucci Mane & Drama, So that means more commas\nIm hands on like a laptop, Get your cap popped this summer (Gucci)\n\nSometimes I, I feel good\nI be in the hood, I just ride by\nSometimes I, I feel bad\nI be in the hood, Might do a drive-by\nSometimes I, I feel good\nI be in the hood, I just ride by\nSometimes I, I be in the hood\n& Im feeling bad, Might do a drive-by\n\n[Future]\nFuture got it bad, Im a drug addict\nWoke up seen a UFO, Im a street fanatic\nMoney out the roof, I had it in the attic\nFlyest nigga on the Earth, Astronaut status\nAstronomical Im phenomenal\nMoney doing flips, Im talking summersaults\nI catch you before summer, Aggravated assault\nWinter time niggas come out with 20 dimes\nFeel like Im on a shroom, All this money in this room\nFriday night lights, Chain still swinging\nIm a rock star, & Im gang banging\nSkulls everywhere, Spikes everywhere\nBloodhound for that money, Catch me anywhere\nI went to space & left some niggas\nI dont fucking care\nI should have went to Yale, The way I move a bail\nDeath before dishonor, Ill never tell\n\nSometimes I, I feel good\nI be in the hood, I just ride by\nSometimes I, I feel bad\nI be in the hood, Might do a drive-by\nSometimes I, I feel good\nI be in the hood, I just ride by\nSometimes I, I be in the hood\n& Im feeling bad, Might do a drive-by\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_7778580/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCABxGgEsqXJYu5Qd5UuPRc7Fl7EHc5Tn8jIgCLZmE9CCdCLHO18yu29rxTZFyEA963VmOCLDPhllxKfCyUBQS1K2fEtE1gV0i6lckxnzYnqyfBNT65dkRoWjsCEuaa8mWXc3L0cilSWC7cTqwz1cjDLwRST_jhumZoJbP-uF934DJBxIwxFVr1DRRNXobBUmHaaRDJqfyNSZwD4IDr8QE_O0pyXHemSyooqN0cAP46MeN3KBjkZfZnb_DGsQ8hrANLBARGwnpyZhptjcat5H234HNMAHk3CmlFuubr_1k4Zv1-ISc_P_PLKMpoDE0wmNPrQ78qYqjS_OQm4aUzA9jhVYBSMVHbIy8vsOzmNoVXaahqOqhod0ciT8jlv-qa6eWBIo6CTBFXDR6wDnkpQaL0nh4l4yKf_kGGQmxb4uyhx5dXhtLXWgQMxr5p0wGZ5YBS2efC-LVte4/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\nThanks to Cody Ellis for adding these lyrics.\nThanks to Katie for correcting these lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap Back\" (2012)\nBig Boss Meech Speaks (Intro)\nBack In 95\nQuiet\nWalking Lick\nPlain Jane\nGet It Back\nTrapBack\nOpposite\nBrick Fair\nGhetto\nThank You\nFace Card\nIn Love With A White Girl\nChicken Room\nOkay With Me\nClub Hoppin\nSometimes\nNorth Pole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
