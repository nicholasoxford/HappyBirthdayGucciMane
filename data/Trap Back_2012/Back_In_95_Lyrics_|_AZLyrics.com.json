Willy used to finger fuck my rims\nThey forgetting on my name so they used to call me Black\nIf you beat me for a twenty beat ya I'm a call you back\nShe on the dope man dick cause I'm a nigger with a sack\nI'm the hustler of the year and I know that for a fact\n\nWhen I first started back in 1995\nI wasn't moving keys, I was buying 1.5\nI started coming up\nJunkies recognize my face\nPaid a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case\nHoliday season\nThey used to run up on me, be like \"Gucci what you know? \"\nI tell them \"get this glass and get the fuck away from me hoe\"\nAnd everywhere I go it became an instant cut\nCause they knew I had those 20's and them big fat monkey nuts\n\nHuh,\nPrice so low that it comin' through snow\nStandin' at the store and I'm selling yae-yo\nBought a brick yesterday got a full way to go\nOn the highway everything got to go\nFifty on the table, a hundred on the floor\nMiddle of the summer but I'm'a make it snow\nLike a chill pet my money don't grow\nStill servin' niggers through my burglar bars though\nShorty G's and a little afro\n8 ball check it and the flow stash milks\nI don't get credit that's how niggers get killed\nAnd if you got a tilt then your car get pelt\n17 going to the 5-5-9\nLike a blind man I don't see no lines\nThirteen when the nigger did his first crime\nEighteen when the nigger bought his first 9\nIf I don't fly then the show ain't flying\nPicking up dope but the J's keep buying\nRob a Q lurk and I know they trying\nTry Gucci Mane their ass be dying\nLet me take you back in time\nLet Gucci Mane refresh your mind\nI'm a dope boss they on my grind\nI could pluck you so hard!\n\nWhen I first started back in 1995\nI wasn't moving keys, I was buying 1.5\nI started coming up\nJunkies recognize of my face\nPaid a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case\nThey used to run up on me, be like \"Gucci what you know? \"\nI tell them \"get this glass and get the fuck away from me hoe\"\nAnd everywhere I go it became an instant cut\nCause they knew I had those 20's and them big fat monkey nuts\n\nAin't no more to say!\nYo Gucci!\nI can't hear all these haters man\nThey got to speak up\nI'm 30000 feet in the air nigger\nFlying over your city to pick up a band\nWhatchyou doin?
