You can get it right now\nPull to the trap house, come to the back\nRiding domestic with the trunk in the back\nRiding in a foreign, so the trunk in the front\nSixty thousand cash just for me to roll blunts\nStanding in front, blowing kush through her dress\nFive grand just to see her dance\nTen grand just to see her tats\nJump in the corner and he smoking on her clit\nWaiting on you, so he get it right back\n\n[Hook 1]\n\n[Hook 2: Gucci Mane]\nIn the club, throwin' money\nI done run through me some racks\nGive a fuck bout that little paper\nI know I get it back\nGet it back, get it back\nBitch, I know I get it back\nGive a fuck bout that little paper\nCause I know I get it back\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nGet it back, get it back\nYeah, you know I get it back\nShorty say she want my name\nSo I bought that bitch a tat\nI walk in this bitch with racks\nTell them, come and get this paper\nYeah, my bitch is made in Asia\nAnd I'm icy like a glacier\nGet your baby momma\nTake her then make her\nYou date her, then fuck her\nI fuck her, then date her\nEverything is on the up\nLike a elevator\nGucci Mane and Tity Boi\nCollege Park and Decatur\nNow I do it for the haters\nStarted with a Buick LeSabre\nEnded with that Ferrari\nTell me, meet me up out in Vegas\nGot so many acres\nI don't ever see my neighbors\nNiggas say they want a mil\nI put money on the table\n\n[Hook 1]\n\n[Hook 2]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8015678/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAFIuCX10z5EHdSQgLSB1ryY644apLSDu2WjH0Ut2EAbpGLPvlw238Soa9tnfUO1xW_9u7mVr7t_aVy87WEhmLB2ONBE12xOStoDTXiad9C76n-ZzEWJoj4insxSC_h_EDUoDzsJOpxONvJ-YrRwpsZNB2NDjvHkArMcxz4OUR-C62JZrRI8HICgLgRnY6T1V7mRqK6njCNXXpc_0OROAx7iccvA8m1KyiprQqalQDsyLYlblOlTvvR9ygnzakboslxrRXecNLYeSukhhWDOKZxH8aWFdIKB7OrrPxsRu-QPC3ddJbpEhcDQu9O7ujKNWgHnKZ82OJ5xg9h4M4oY5jUhCFdFoOJCyyuSc3ARWkX9eVw6lVv9Czl5CVt-E-9rRIHAuFu8f-W6WvKOAOMAWGMre6hmhqAQf53OzNa6CLrzSZilmyAAZftCXVQ11RNkHp7r9Mfht3Q9nS_2f/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Gucci Mane\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap Back\" (2012)\nBig Boss Meech Speaks (Intro)\nBack In 95\nQuiet\nWalking Lick\nPlain Jane\nGet It Back\nTrapBack\nOpposite\nBrick Fair\nGhetto\nThank You\nFace Card\nIn Love With A White Girl\nChicken Room\nOkay With Me\nClub Hoppin\nSometimes\nNorth Pole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
