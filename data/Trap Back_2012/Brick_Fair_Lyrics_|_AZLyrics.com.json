Monopoly\nYou know it is A1 what up?\nI see the future\nHoliday season\n\nEver since I got brick fair\nI never look back there\nIf you ain't from the zone six\nThen Shorty don't go there\nI might die a bachelor\nGirlfriend, I don't want that\nI already smashed her\nSo don't even go there\nEver since I got brick fair\n\nSaid them boys don't play fair\nI'm from east atlanta zone six\nAnd the kid got rich there\nHell yea we got bails there\nAnd you know we got bricks there\nIf the police pull me over\nI'll probably get the damn chair\nFirst one off the bench nigga\nYou can call me The Six Man\nA lot of squares in my living room\nAka I'm The Brick Man\nAnd I heard that you a snitch player\nSo we gon throw you in the ditch player\nThe way I wrestle with the work nigga\nPeople call me Rig Flare\n\nEver since I got brick fair\nI never look back there\nIf you ain't from the zone six\nThen Shorty don't go there\nI might die a bachelor\nGirlfriend, I don't want that\nI already smashed her\nSo don't even go there\nEver since I got brick fair\n\nDirty as fuck, dirty ass pistol\nMy lil a goon in the hood, an' he just wait for me to hit 'em\nDo you got a body for me beggin on the line\nAnd when I do it would you do or not\nHit 'em in the head\nI had a extra five pushin weight like I'm doing exercise\nMoving up the interstate and I got the bales an' pies\nI go Pauli Castellano\nI'm a mafia Santano\nI got accepted to the mob and i think\nI'm Tony Soprano\nWithout the TV you wanna be me if you see me\nThis A1 FBGB we hit onxy on our PT\nHe water all our CG\nI make real movies in HD\nI'm an astronaut in my real life\nI promise you can't see me\n\nEver since I got brick fair\nI never look back there\nIf you ain't from the zone six\nThen Shorty don't go there\nI might die a bachelor\nGirlfriend, I don't want that\nI already smashed her\nSo don't even go there\nEver since I got brick fair\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_11706784/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAGbhEj0Q6iv5xdBVKVekHlbMfrkJ1I26jOpMVFNhRX_3JiLu_h2WY4gqmCjWMXUOgEKDJhHNr9S8owzg_ly8VBKHPWFe8Nd5c_BvxI9leqgAsTsXmxHZdXgG47iRftlJRfQ1mrAXEBZZboZAVNgIi1pz_P5Yof8_Kb7gpwSz6IpIHGMvZGCN63_bXlkk4xdaOSx6bcyg-1Pxx-P6Oja5OwjJGlrFnmDk81ZsnbbJhhjXkht9ynIY36f3jG-v2J2FtGJ3UJtglgyEiLIOP8OvlSAR4rrG_4Cr6c30LgvPW9Yhoyyg4clS88hl1BZYi5dk3_rZvZzi7x-OHABDZ1xthonn-PzZNmVXWOMFtm3xmDJ1Liu_BcOn1c_I8ag_Kj73hNHOvvuDmvKGCgetcGwRvNxqvVpP47pFu6zXyzU2-dNa4QNsaxBoHZd7uiuFauSC7T3YuTOt6Xgjhw/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\nThanks to Quay Simms for correcting these lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap Back\" (2012)\nBig Boss Meech Speaks (Intro)\nBack In 95\nQuiet\nWalking Lick\nPlain Jane\nGet It Back\nTrapBack\nOpposite\nBrick Fair\nGhetto\nThank You\nFace Card\nIn Love With A White Girl\nChicken Room\nOkay With Me\nClub Hoppin\nSometimes\nNorth Pole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
