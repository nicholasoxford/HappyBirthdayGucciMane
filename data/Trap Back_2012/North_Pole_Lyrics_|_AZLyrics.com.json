Blow!\n\nRed falcons hat, all red hooded\nSanta clause of the city, bag full of goodies\n50 pints of purple drank, came with the seal\nI wish these faggot ass cops will let a nigga live\nOr tryna to come down the chimney with a hunred mil\nSo many hundred dollar bills that'll give you chills\nA bad bitch from Brazil got her own appeal\nYou wake up see her cooking cookies in your crib\nI'm the brick squad boss, I'm like Santa Claus\nMisses clause on the pole, with her panties off\nAnd I know when you're sleeping know when you awake\nNo eggnog, busting bottles of that ace of spades\nBlack Versace shades so it's hard to steer\nWhere's Rudolph red nose when I really need him\nA bunch of elves on the team and I gotta feed em\nThey carry sawed off pumps so it's hard to feed em\nI gift wrap a pipe bomb, bring it to your door\nRing the bell sit back and watch the fucker blow\nSo how you build the snowman with all this melted snow\nSanta clause bringing blocks in from Mexico\nI made a hundred thousand dollars and the Texaco\nThey locked me up and let me out I feel like Plexico\nI'm going in on these suckers call me Santa Claus\nAnd it's a bunch of bad bitches in Santa house\nAn igloo full of snow and a white stove\nI'm in the kitchen cooking dope in a white robe\nHouse full of naked hoes snortin blow\nI'm in zone 6 aka the north pole\nIt's so lonely at the top plus it's real cold\nMy ears, neck, wrist fist is real froze\nA house full of hoes and they cooking blow\nI'm in zone 6 aka the north pole.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_7280748/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCANlhy7t2IeeuhekQr3BbhY4FYZYGbYoEAQrvWkHt7HDuQAZteipsOKSyNrN18nyW5JyKAqovJwr-NMwj4TdAPdlRQkWLE5Y7l50y6BZWTiHFbwU-gA1Gqv3p56JLej0o1UQh8Mn1TaWGBQWLf4miVgn6JnzdtKDVn9CUbnAVIW9e3_00IcsK4SUsCw3O11VNFugnzip1fE-4N679sQ5nKzLBa1khZmTXJRdEWYgyAUQggepTq4TColJ7djzUqdDkrVT3lYuxGWcJFe7d70cZTDslwAP1WzCrH9Sb8eMzynQze0xaYF5Ba6mla3QnpnBPVoZMdLKLSLH2RBLCrVF2GBsP5gMJEfMkT6P31DTB4fzAxK8I9muxzG9bq3uJJWzX__O0U30K5bfwwaoIaeHN5h9pcRzSAM-e-vbwQhUN_ERgAhnsshM6vCI5jart/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap Back\" (2012)\nBig Boss Meech Speaks (Intro)\nBack In 95\nQuiet\nWalking Lick\nPlain Jane\nGet It Back\nTrapBack\nOpposite\nBrick Fair\nGhetto\nThank You\nFace Card\nIn Love With A White Girl\nChicken Room\nOkay With Me\nClub Hoppin\nSometimes\nNorth Pole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
