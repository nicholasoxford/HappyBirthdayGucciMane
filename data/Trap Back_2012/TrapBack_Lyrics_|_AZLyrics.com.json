I'm santa\nI need a crown cause I'm standing down, I'm the king of east Atlanta\n\nI don't wanna have to push your cap back\nHomie, he just say he want his girl back\nIn a drop top, I'm a push the top back\nI was gone for a second, but the kid back\nIf you ever cross me I'm a get some payback\nClose the curtain on them haters, in my Maybach\nPut a hole in your motherfuckin snapback\nIt's Gucci Mane bitch, so you can say the Trap Back\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_7732525/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAKE21ZucFS13w6jooOv_1cL6JJ72eiO9sVXX80e5CaYoemnj72sI6RjFkC1ammk4tfgqBi9XNOWX_3VqdC94hHhVcKrXPldXFaCziitiEL_CEZpatOj3piC5HOu-w8-GfO1O997xDHFjkVmEAB3WKefM9lkAJZoYJYNaANoRPprbSMgQTfN2ZGbc8bCgIaMhHWbXntOUmy2rhtojlsl-WF8oJUcZgzFWoozTTrVNr7OfeqPmC8wcAPBd2AXF-ACQuyt3K-apBJPSRK3Y5DhufMAE9OHtZW5iM8PDL8q5WNor-sr7tMioTFads5jm0pJf4za-wGBD-gCdtb5iViaRhDe_mLI5vRXvazc_4ZSI-ULQOuhQuqRIdIfcOmot0rHdbOQkAKL0CbGysPnimpD6ci_RVaHRGb0qXn5JS0Jijucunlyb4J04SsjXHos/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Radric Davis, Joshua Luellen\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap Back\" (2012)\nBig Boss Meech Speaks (Intro)\nBack In 95\nQuiet\nWalking Lick\nPlain Jane\nGet It Back\nTrapBack\nOpposite\nBrick Fair\nGhetto\nThank You\nFace Card\nIn Love With A White Girl\nChicken Room\nOkay With Me\nClub Hoppin\nSometimes\nNorth Pole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
