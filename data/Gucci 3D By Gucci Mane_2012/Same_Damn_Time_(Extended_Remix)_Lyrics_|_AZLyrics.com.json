Rick Ross, Ludacris, Wale, Meek Mill, Gunplay, Future)\n\n\n\n[Hook: Future]\nI wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time\nOn the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time\nSelling white, selling mid, at the same damn time\nFucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nI'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time\nOn the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nFuck your sister and you girl at the same damn time\nAll these diamonds that I rock could make a bitch go blind\nYella ice, white ice at the same damn time\nWalkin' straight in the club, I don't stand in no line\nKnow my glasses Jimmy Chus but I got them Gucci shoes\nRule the Louie V and Prada that I swear I'm so confused\nI got the future Linige mall in the same damn day\nSpendin' 10k in future, feel the same damn way\nServe my baby momma brother, got the same ole grind\nSellin' bills, sellin' bricks at the same damn time\nI get better every year so my flow is like wine\nI'm a rapper and a trapper at the same damn time\n\n[Hook: Future]\nI wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time\nOn the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time\nSelling white, selling mid, at the same damn time\nFucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nI'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time\nOn the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nWhipping white and baking soda, at the same damn time\nPuffy got a mansion, bitch I got the same damn kind\nWent and bought two sixty twos, at the same damn time\nRock an AP and a Rolly, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nStill selling boy and girl, at the same damn time\nSelling cane, getting brain, at the same damn time\nAll the women say my name, at the same damn time\nLetting off two different choppers at the same damn time\nPutting down in different projects at the same damn time\nDope money still a object, it's the same damn grind\nBut I got two platinum artists, at the same damn time\nWent and got two Maseratis at the same damn time\nLiberace, John Gotti, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, it's the same damn grind\nCaptain boy, cooking crack, at the same damn time\nOn my Twitter writing raps, at the same damn time\nGetting head counting bread, at the same down time\n\n[Verse 3: Wale]\nShe on Molly, she with Mary, at the same damn time\nWe the squad, Young Folarin, out that Maybach Mob\nFuck a tape, fuck your broad\nMiddle finger up, to the mother fucking law\nNo days off, Gunplay ball, sick with the cross like DeRon going off\nAt the same damn time\nShape like a eight, face like a nine\nHeard she dancin' at Kamal's, and she make too much to stop\nAnd she stripping, go to college\nAnd they trickin' her deposit\nWhile them bitches always gossip, she busy going shopping\nAt the same, at the same time\nAnd your girl don't show her face when I be FaceTimin'\nSB Nike's, with the grey box\nYou in the past me and Future on the same watch\n\n[Hook: Future]\nI wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time\nOn the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time\nSelling white, selling mid, at the same damn time\nFucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nI'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time\nOn the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time\n\n[Verse 4: Gunplay]\nAll black, khaki jumper, actin' a donkey\nAt the same damn time, got these bitches poppin' monkey\nMetro Zoo in here, with my crew in here\nWith all these hogs in the game no room for you in here\nLimo tints on my shades, skinnies on my blades\nCrocodile kicks like my hood the Everglades\nRich forever paid\nDo it with no effort, now let's effin' celebrate\nToast and spill the grapes, hoes catchin' vapes\nToe touchin' freaks\nShe jumped on my pole and did a pole trick for me\nSlippin' on ya pimpin' that means more grip for me\nChrome lips on the Forgi's damn near swallowing the street\nYou owe me, homie have that now\nI'm a pull that Gat out now\nMust be out your rabbit mind, I'm thuggin', rappin', same damn time\n\n[Verse 5: Meek Mill]\nI rock Gucci, I rock Louie, at the same damn time\nI shoot you and kill ya homie, with the same damn nine\nIn kitchen, whippin' blow, it got the same damn crumbs\nI need a ho that's like my pro without the same damn mind\nAt the same damn time, gettin' hit on by a couple hoes\nTwo big faces on my wrist, boy I got a couple those\nI told her I love that pussy, she think we a couple though\nAnd she got a boyfriend but she say he a sucka though\nAt the same time, pull up like James Bond\nIn that Aston Martin on these niggas, game time\nFresh ass Mike's, my Rollie on ice\nGot bitches on Mollies, they rollin' all night\nI be way out in Cali, got hoes of all types\nWith 80 racks in my pocket, nigga I go in all night\n\n[Hook: Everybody]\nI wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time\nOn the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time\nSelling white, selling mid, at the same damn time\nFucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nI'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time\nOn the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time\n\n[Verse 6: Ludacris]\nYeaah Luda is unstoppable, his money is astronomical\nSell as many records as a nigga like me that shit is just impossible\nRappers is dillusional and now they talking more shit\nAnything is lie when it coming out the mouth of a desperate starving broke Bitch\nChoke Bitch, you used to be good but now you're garbage\nAny nigga that wanna step up to the plate and battle will get demolished\nMy flows is rubbing off just like their fingernail polish\nYou rappers ain't got no swag, you need to kill your Fucking stylist\nThey biting like piranhas then crying to their momma\nThese Niggas best to call their troops back like Obama\nThat trash that you're spitting didn't faze me, matter of fact your record label still pays me\nSee Luda never starting shit, I'm always on my grind, but I'll respond to three rappers at the same damn time\n\n[Hook: Future]\nI wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time\nOn the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time\nSelling white, selling mid, at the same damn time\nFucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nAt the same damn time, at the same damn time\nI'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time\nOn the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n
