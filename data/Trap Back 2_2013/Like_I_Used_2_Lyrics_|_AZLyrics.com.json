Payin car, no it's a line bitch\nI didn't have a job but the work still had tax still\n47 that boulder, crystal house where the pack live\nBout 10 park apartment where the roaches and the rats live\nI don't respect money nigga, I respect real\nPut yo ass kill over motherfuckin addled\nThe young niggas with me poppin mollies like they Advil\n\n[Hook:]\nI can't fuck a nigga bitch like I used 2\nWish I could fuck a nigga bitch like I used 2\nShe can't suck a nigga dick like she used 2\nWish she can suck a nigga dick like she used 2\nWish I could fuck a nigga bitch like I used 2\nI can't fuck a nigga bitch like I used 2\nShe can't suck a nigga dick like she used 2\nWish she can suck a nigga dick like she used 2\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_9594968/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCADdj6SK12lr-F8-JDx6x2ZjXtI6eCzeW-OSQ1kppUep8pzNevhCe5DEhjHfX810A3UTKtPP0EEo00TK4Kz045_fX6kTi3ZsfZ9I7-_WK_GWTqEyaDbr27XFiC7yzhVQyrDXuyLs0h6kXSBodDnJuLhx2qM2rVHp1BU92FPffnlXj-q1tn0N4z2i76rqqzwPzsD97h0r1eRaxjQlY4UGdsLEybxGaUb2VGKLYi1CjyB33Ys3CSSaotOlrOrQ4YylK1Qk-vgS_9QONG0q8wyu935AmuC7kghZqkuiyuMB_lgTiSir6jXCygQtHMzQWlnBeEaGU5pZ4p2uF7HPzR5hdyFMht2oQ5p15l0fZQsZRfcydh928dGUK_V-hMFU4PVebGsCAAIsubAFsQHYzoTuMF3u5552AXpQKOZyddOAKaDYDUg_oy9J1qxTHSSNg9jVNy9Pd/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Xavier L.
