Go bout what it say on the papers\nMight move to Oakland just to watch a game of the Raiders\nNo flexin, they connect this with the dope like the cable\nWhen I go to table you can tell that I'm huntin\nMy stomach get cravin, it's smellin them hundreds\nCan you feelin it comin? I'm not in it for money\nAnd I had to say, I can make a bitch do some crazy things\n\n[Hook:]\nI can em dudes do some crazy things\nFelt so good, make her Jackie do some crazy things\nChoppa with me, I might do some crazy things\nI got yo girlfriend with me, she gon do some crazy things\nI got straight A on them 6's, it's some crazy things\nIt felt so good, it made us now look at yo crazy dreams\nI got that gangsta Gucci Mane, that shit amazing man\nAin't never white bitches at my party, it's crazy man\n\n[Verse 2:]\nJackie gon slap crazy, my trap is crazy\nYou'd think this shit was 1980's and I fucked with Ray\nI didn't had no daddy to bring the baking soda, brought home the bacon\nAnd if you think you gon put Guwap in then you son is mistakin\nI got 200 thousand cash on me, I'm a go to Vegas\nAnd I don't need no fuckin no Jenny crib, my money overweight\nI don't even pay the rent cause always overpay\nAnd I overtippin 100's cause I'm Gucci man, I'm rich to stay\nI go anywhere I wanna go, I double dare you to try to flap\nI'm a have to flake er to because this pussy gon have to come in now\nI'm a flip the pack and switch the spots, I know the folks gon run me now\nAnd you can tell me shit bout East Atlanta, bitch I know it's money though\n\n[Hook:]\nI can em dudes do some crazy things\nFelt so good, make her Jackie do some crazy things\nChoppa with me, I might do some crazy things\nI got yo girlfriend with me, she gon do some crazy things\nI got straight A on them 6's, it's some crazy things\nIt felt so good, it made us now look at yo crazy dreams\nI got that gangsta Gucci Mane, that shit amazing man\nAin't never white bitches at my party, it's crazy man\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_9553515/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCALuhtyp0ApxiwBf9zxJvl1A0mAWU3x9hDsoV289cxDoe-dg5UfHiUPO5Z1H89f5mTJngEy_VVASwHzHk5DpRHPiCpNRvgHL-krQdl9QBycj02vMzoZL1h5v6KRt71pQQg-rqXKCnCMSBH0k3a7BXHDyIa7TnpLKwf5zILjOomdN4KalCfAVcrORyAoHRWBGGw_qtTQyQ21MOpCcRt5Gx5O3kLyec4YNMoGX17u0qXQzBJ_EG6EpzaLYoAh8aMkIvwckpQ7qZLyVKx4-E0PjYxeEBzoCbd8i0nmhwkmC1SPSBqLQ8e-pzLwI0gbIPCKvbIycXQzgmgcQE5RgFNMyOWaeTvwRozUYdirO4dIT5Maz3rjiNkkumjocnfRbsKY3mOCYunOhGycKVNsL0TWxrOqbCYAvcGGTL3T462OYqns9I2wRx7qenEOPbw08eZM3eDJs/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap Back 2\" (2013)\nDont Deserve It\nFamily Tree\nPlayin With The Money\nThirtsy\nCrush\nHood Bitches\nLike I Used 2\nCant Walk\nDumb Fine\nThat Pack\nCrazy Things\nIron On Me\nDone With Her\nFull Of It\nPicture That\nJames Worthy\nWhite Man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
