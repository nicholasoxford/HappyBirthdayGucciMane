All I fuck with hood bitches\nLike them hood bitches, yea I fuck with hood bitches\nWhere the hood bitches? Point me to the hood bitches\nIt's Guwap in this bitch and I want them hood bitches\nWhere the hood bitches? Tell me where the hood bitches\nWhere the hood bitches? Point me to them hood bitches\nGucci Mane in this bitch, I got my hood bitch\nYou ain't no hood bitch, I need them hood bitches\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI'm a black it tonight with a bitch so bad\nThat she rode a bike but she not a dike\nShe got a man but she wear the pants\nSo I guess the pussy nigga got her panties tight\nI said here's the plan, he's a lame\nRespect the game, bring me the white\nDo it again, I'm the Gucci Mane\nMy fuckin round made you my man\nMany things but a change of heart\nCause she came in with some granny panties\nI'm so picky that my dick went limp\nAnd I had to keep the poor bitch out the mansion\nYea young nigga got a 4-5\nBut a nigga just to ass and pants\nThese hood bitches give the best head\nWhen I fuck her I keep a pistol handed\n\n[Hook:]\nWhere the hood bitches? All I fuck with hood bitches\nLike them hood bitches, yea I fuck with hood bitches\nWhere the hood bitches? Point me to the hood bitches\nIt's Guwap in this bitch and I want them hood bitches\nWhere the hood bitches? Tell me where the hood bitches\nWhere the hood bitches? Point me to them hood bitches\nGucci Mane in this bitch, I got my hood bitch\nYou ain't no hood bitch, I need them hood bitches\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_9538949/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAG4rKcAWCzRDm7JoRHA95W1PPvLE-YO3Zj-bGdm6bhlUCy5P1eSe8jglJd96192xc0wb9H8_9fSPzUmL1Ji87FxrrLkGaPMly1Cma9scRfn8qY6F34DqVGhtUynN0F4n_Yg2AG00GcQrR7XHUTksbeml0WqS5zzQ65rGBXY2W5JtYMKJ1R74Llkw08AwGntQIbHL0DvNEB-og9kNjuMjwXgdQRQnYHsRqeVtXg10vj6zi5Gfm2qRJsumpnF2a5gLPDRiZXYBQKaVl-pToh_NDKnyYxadN8lQgYRGPWj218nDWU5AdaBryHtQFhE1_K6dxOnaE4t6_fuMiJhHdRT-AEutRV1TTR04eGCnFmsXSZ24arnAY4XOJf-dLXBIJ31tLSXpyCKVD91PQubH9Iio-LIx9dQNhfuWXUIvcxUS0FkJhuOS3C2sSz_GhD0RqW6nRw/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Trap Back 2\" (2013)\nDont Deserve It\nFamily Tree\nPlayin With The Money\nThirtsy\nCrush\nHood Bitches\nLike I Used 2\nCant Walk\nDumb Fine\nThat Pack\nCrazy Things\nIron On Me\nDone With Her\nFull Of It\nPicture That\nJames Worthy\nWhite Man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
