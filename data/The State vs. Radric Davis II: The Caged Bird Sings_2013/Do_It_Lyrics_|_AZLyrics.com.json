You know that you didn't have to do it\nIt was clean fore you did it, you didn't have to do it\nIt was a 2013 car, man you didn't have to do it\nIt's Gucci Mane izay, you know we overdo it\nThey back in the Lamborghini man, they didn't have to do it\nThey got so much, man it's so much, influence didn't have to do it\nThey know that Gucci Mane stay fresh and he didn't have to do it\n\n[Verse 1:]\nDon't need no stylist, I'm so fresh, I didn't even have to do it\nMy car cost half a million dollars and I didn't have to do it\nI paint that bitch instantly and put them Forgies to it\nI merk a nigga instantly, this shit here more than music\nAs far as me, them niggas phony, that's balony music\nThese niggas so corny I'd be baloney if I listened to it\nI paint my car soon as I get it, bitch I gotta do it\nAnd get how many, can even a man take car paint that's on a Buick\nI make a bitch feel insecure but she still listen to it\nShe in the car, don't know what it is but ain't like she knew\nYou with a nigga with a check, this a Rari not a Vette\nThis ain't that same little lick that he got, man this Bentley cost 3-20 man\nIt's Gucci, I got plenty, me in city, we be killin shit\nSoon as you take drop man it's gon be trinity and it's have her 50\nI have my mind on a V, I'm trappin out abandoned buildings\nThey say the rims on my Charger bitch are bigger than they children\n\n[Hook:]\nWhy you painted that motherfucker? You didn't have to do it\nWhy you flood yo wife? You know that you didn't have to do it\nIt was clean fore you did it, you didn't have to do it\nIt was a 2013 car, man you didn't have to do it\nIt's Gucci Mane izay, you know we overdo it\nThey back in the Lamborghini man, they didn't have to do it\nThey got so much, man it's so much, influence didn't have to do it\nThey know that Gucci Mane stay fresh and he didn't have to do it\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI didn't have to do it but I did it, man I did it\nYo I do it when I do it, drop top Rari, yea we stupid\nGot that Rollie, flooded it out with Cuban diamonds, man they ready blew this\nGroupies I don't give a fuck, I'm flippin!\nI pour lean and some blue Kool-Aid and now I'm feelin like lipsy\nTook my car service to Slawson, bought 10 Patriot from the 60's\nWhy you pass that blunt to me? Baby you know that shit too skinny\nI stick my blunt and stuff my safe, I can't even close at all em 20's\n\n[Hook:]\nWhy you painted that motherfucker? You didn't have to do it\nWhy you flood yo wife? You know that you didn't have to do it\nIt was clean fore you did it, you didn't have to do it\nIt was a 2013 car, man you didn't have to do it\nIt's Gucci Mane izay, you know we overdo it\nThey back in the Lamborghini man, they didn't have to do it\nThey got so much, man it's so much, influence didn't have to do it\nThey know that Gucci Mane stay fresh and he didn't have to do it\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_9343499/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAOtnihOMpVLzqNXzVvf7C4t0LNPCdh0flxRB0EHpsKRUtptyXPDmKsGCy8Wps5jaT3-kOL0BtxlIrekh4wO_WHyBLjOcEdMJNmZYpN4qtIPcM7yWtNMcpO-ZRTPkEmbVBu3FsYTsSwirJcGAYHneRbjaeUxc-hnRL-57dAghn2bJ904Nr0cldcd38jeJI_vNIv9IbD-MxGBeyFBcEwhaPyTCRlIR6-AOMu7z3ajEQQJ0PQxw4gUXhPhCp93wBjc2oN9ohJK2wRN3KWLlOhvRcah3HLwXJeiOz_jATBYoDrIKT7JZRKkEFwYf9EHF_8oMWqQguI6Sew2UPt62LlqKci_YHCzb4YdXqXMrIQc0-TsXTIVjS_tcBYqeoyFtY1ywyHaA96PuXSjDwSQu52wjg0QpZVFdY6WI_jtZyta46-zg8I3R5IeZyytXfYE/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Davis Radric Delantic, Williams Otis\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nalbum: \"The State vs. Radric Davis II: The Caged Bird Sings\" (2013)\nPull Up On Ya\nJackie Chan\n#Mentionme\nRude\nBirdman\nDouble\nBad Bitch\nTell Me Nothing\nToo Many\nWish You Was Me\nIce Cold\nFugitive\nFeets\nButtnaked\nAny Thing\nDo It\nThrew With That Shit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
