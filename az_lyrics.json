Its alive..its alive\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nIt's alive, it's alive\nRims cut the eyes\nI had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein\nI push weight, but Gucci don't exercise\nI get extra from whippin up extra pies\nIm in the hood like the mayor round election time\nIt's a suggestion, don't park your car next to mine\nIma start when the light hit, Im 'posed to shine\nYour flow is garbage, they let me out just in time\nThey got a section, but none of the hoes are fine\nThey need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by\nI run laps around lames with my shoes untied\nI jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide\nStill stuck outside, that's the ugly side\nLooked medusa in the eye and medusa died\nThis is top secret shit, classified\nDon't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind\nCan't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time\nI got my chain moonwalkin, Michael Jackson time\nI keep on buying ice like I lost my mind\nThis bloodline of mine is supposed to shine\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]\nHurry up, hurry up Gucci on the news, they say he walked out the jail rockin stupid jewels\nThey try and find out what it do, admit it, you confused\nToo much cash on me, hundreds fallin out me, true\nBig yellow wrists, bright as piss, bitch Im the shit\nBig Gucci called Swizz, lets make a hit\n2 things in this world I ain't ever seen\nAre you a foreigner nigga? I need to help me get me me\nWell if your stomach cannot tote it baby, let me breathe\nCuz I dont check if no babe or bitch chasin me\nExcuse my French, bitch Im so Gucci, I so fuckin gutter\nIt dont make no sense to switch for none these mother fuckas\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]\nSomebody said my life is it\nI said nah dog, my wife is it\nNow I'm back, back on 'em like I never, never left\nPlus the boy right here, I'm fresh to death\nAnd the Black Card in my back pocket\nThe Conaseg lookin' like a speeder rocket\nYeah, I'm zoomin' on the highway\nAnd you should love me, I did it my way\n\n[Hook]\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_6438305/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAC_EGgffQow3Ama7tj6eVYLPLZCjH_3JIFOuThmOqv5BZNzZzHbaBZZS0xgtu36bfh8V0_KOxhZm9c3up_c8kyBrEjw1S5JDCRhYr4azPvmacaFlFIB2CzZL6IgtCtIpflGGRhbGm00lPyvxxrt9fDT-c0WYJepBZ73cRca4z5GoKKASDfUGr-MIoaEQZFmoFyr-73vjZbEpN2IjHkz0X2chPsusjhpUAx3pGRoRVgCkFSICtrt_VG47qw0w-QTdukh599OlDnTayF7ajwTeX86DS3Wnx6vAjArp4e56e-UhK0sCqH640NLz27oTzSaSsFuusegMBuQtgkrJ-TErVhOCgASU7o6qH_EXa1oDCTJZba2TF0a9_g5ZKKGL1kkiooyOST7ZxBUyTYmbb_mXLN9FXpdsG5_1692dTWPii8xBIFfx8pdywVUCqQjurt2BeBeoQBvuiWc4LPsv2eB_w6SVZA/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Davis Radric Delantic, Dean Kasseem\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Way Below Zero\" (2010)\nBoogeyman\nDollar Sign\nMissing\nHoes\nTrap Talk\nBite Me\nDon't Believe Me\nYeahhh (Pop Your Back)\nVampire\nGucci Time\nIt's Alive\nMaybe (Remix)\n\n\nalbum: \"The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted\" (2010)\nLittle Friend\nTrap Talk\nMissing\nWhat It's Gonna Be\nMaking Love To The Money\nGucci Time\nParty Animal\nRemember When\nHaterade\nIt's Alive\nODog\nDollar Sign\nBrand New\nWeirdo\nGrown Man\nBeat It Up(iTunes Bonus Track)\nGeorgia's Most Wanted(iTunes Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",

Prada that I swear I'm so confused\nI got the future Linige mall in the same damn day\nSpendin' 10k in future, feel the same damn way\nServe my baby momma brother, got the same ole grind\nSellin'

Luda is unstoppable, his money is astronomical\nSell as many records as a nigga like me that shit is just impossible\nRappers is dillusional and now they talking more shit\nAnything is lie when it coming out the mouth of a desperate starving broke Bitch\nChoke Bitch, you used to be good but now you're garbage\nAny nigga that wanna step up to the plate and battle will get demolished\nMy flows is rubbing off just like their fingernail polish\nYou rappers ain't got no swag, you need to kill your Fucking stylist\nThey biting like piranhas then crying to their momma\nThese Niggas best to call

Waka Flocka)\n\n\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\nI smoke weed for breakfast, I drink lean for breakfast\nI take mollies, I take Xanax, I can't eat no breakfast\nHalf a pound for breakfast, two grams of molly, breakfast\nA pint of lean for breakfast and I'm cookin' dope for breakfast\nI smoke weed for breakfast, I drink lean for breakfast\nI take mollies, I take Xanax, I can't eat no breakfast\nHalf a pound for breakfast, two grams of molly, breakfast\nA pint of lean for breakfast, I got collard greens for breakfast\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nBitin' on my lip for breakfast, can't serve that trick unless...\nWe on two different levels, Flock said he just came from Belgium\nMy trap house right off Gresham, I'm so goddamn successful\nShe ate my dick for dinner then she ate my lips for breakfast\nGot a big booty bitch with some nice size titties\nBaby so fine, gotta let her ride with me\nShe the type of bitch gets an F550\nYou the type of bitch can't get one penny\nSmoke 75 blunts in one minute\nI ain't finna eat no Denny's or Wendy's\nI sure ain't broke and I sure ain't friendly\nI don't flash shows if the show got plenty\nIf the show a smorgasbord then I won't get skinny\nPour the lean so dark that it look like Henny\nIt's breakfast time and y'all niggas come get it\nIf you wanna go to war, pussy nigga I'm with it\nI peeped it, you piece of shit\nTry to creep on, nigga, I seen it\nPut a beam on a nigga for treason\nI'll kill a fuck nigga, no reason\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\n\n[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]\nPocket full of mollies, blow them pounds out the window\nDiamond Cuban gold link chain cost a kilo\nGet it fronted by amigo, plus I got a hit single\nMotherfuck these niggas, what the Hell they sayin'?\nCrossed over, still stay 'hood\nSteel top on my Phantom hood\nCan't cook dope but a nigga shoot good\nGot your baby mama walkin' on my hardwood\nOrange juice and five Backwoods for breakfast\n80, 000 dollars on a young nigga necklace\nCan't hit the club if them hoes ain't naked\nWaka Flocka Flame is so damn reckless\nNiggas puttin' bands on they head, just wreck it\nPocket full of hundreds, don't do no debit\nOnly smoke gas, you smoke unleaded\nBrick Squad hittin' lanes, found the exit\nSmoke another pound, my nigga\nWhere the fuck you from? Throw your 'hood up, nigga\nDiamonds in my mouth, can't do golds, my nigga\nShorty be boozed, kicked back on the leather\nKeep it real, chase cheddar\nShe'll fuck for some red-bottoms and a Givenchy sweater\nThat hoe ain't shit  type of bitch that set me up\nPeeWee in the cut with a scrap and a double cup\nShe ain't see him...\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\n\n[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]\nIn the morning I'm still geekin', lickin' Miley Cyrus for breakfast\nThree bad bitches from the Playboy Mansion,\nI'm PeeWee Longway Hefner\nGot pink double-sealed in my refrigerator, I pour mud up for breakfast\nGot a place, said he want a load of collard greens\nMeet me on Metropolitan at the Burger King\nWent out for breakfast, nigga, me and Waka and Gucci\nJust finessed it up, $4, 000 gas, pass in a Bentley truck\nWe eat rats, that's how we get full\nIf you a rat, we got the semi-auto full, boy\nTook your ice in, that shit, I ain't Bird\nCatch a tail from the light I'll come and make this year\n2013 I tip, tryna calm my whip\nRappers talkin' 'bout the table, countin' up my chips\nSippin' on mud, drinkin' out the mug\nWith a nigga misses, boy, I know he pissed\nLean got me trippin', is it workin'?

On a night like this\nOn a night like this? On a night like this\nOn a night like this? On a night like this\n\nMight get that on a night like this, get car-jacked on a night like this\nI don't wanna dap, but you know I wanna scrap, and you might get whacked on a night like this\nOn a night like this? Yeah my nigga on a night like this\nOn a night like this...\n\nOn a night like this a nigga might get killed, whack that nigga, give his ass the whole clip\nMight send a bitch to attract that nigga. Tease that nigga. Distract that nigga\nRan off on the third, get killed on the fifth. Hit him in the head with the damn four-fifth\nLater in the club he was smoking that piff', shot him in the head he ain't leave no tip\nGot my lean in the car, (you) can't take no sip. Can't lean, can't walk, can't crawl, can't limp\nOne of them nights when you don't get right, don't fix your face then your ass get killed\nThat's what you get trynna act all stiff, coming up the hill too swift I'll rip one\nBlood or a crip, (don't) give a damn. I'll hit one. If you don't got a gun, then you better go get one\nOne of them nights when I don't wanna fight, put your hands on me, and I'm ending your life\nSay it to my left, cause you know it ain't right. Call me Tyronne, cause I know I ain't right\nI'm the type of nigga that get in a fight, by the end of the night they'll be reading my rights\nI got the right to shoot your ass on sight, I got the right to put an end to your life\nIf they rob you once, they'll rob you twice. You a pussy ass nigga, you ain't bout that life\n\nOn a night like this, on a night like this\nOn a night like this, man a nigga killed on a night like this\nOn a night like this, on a night like this\nOn a night like this, I'll kidnap your wife on a night like this\nCar-jack me a nigga on a night like this, on a night like this\nMight whack me a nigga on a night like this, on a night like this\nPut some goons on a nigga, they'll be in your house on a night like this\n\n[Waka Flocka:]\nUh huh (where he at? where he at?), on a night like this you could lose your life\nUh huh (where he at? where he at?), on a night like this you could lose your life\nMost my niggas rock red, some rock blue. Backdoor a nigga, leave him sick: bird-flu\nSell it in the two's, next flip by a coupe. You saying fuck me? Nah pussy nigga, fuck you\nI'm still the same nigga on the blocks selling rocks, rule number 1 - don't fuck with the cops\n50 for a show, 80,000 for the watch. I'm a real game spitter, shawty slicker than a fox\nWith a phone call, boy I could get you hit. My niggas hold pistols like they legit\nSend them killers at your ass, better hope they miss. You ain't bout that life, you just pop this shit\nI could see through the mist, shawty snakes in the grass. Dropped out of school, still above my class\nReal right now, even realer in my past. You don't like what I've become, shawty kiss my ass\nI'm my own boss, that's why these niggas mad. Phantom ghost, paid it off cash, that's why they mad\nHahah, SQUAD, SQUAD, SQUAD, FLOCKA!\n\n[Gucci Mane:]\nOn a night like this, on a night like this\nOn a night like this, man a nigga killed on a night like this\nOn a night like this, on a night like this\nOn a night like this, I'll kidnap your wife on a night like this\nCar-jack me a nigga on a night like this, on a night like this\nMight whack me a nigga on a night like this, on a night like this\nPut some goons on a nigga, they'll be in your house on a night like this\n\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.getElementById('azmxmbanner').style.display='block';\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"//adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_8211466/su_0/rs_0/tr_3vUCAFbHWtZzwUhY5fEW8A7nCUbwh9pOmFlhhH7a7-na-axA2HAC48gJ4n0mXwA1qDHPKZ_E7s2n4eoq5ewUvfY4xWUNyjdK9_BbWaKYmeV9_humyZenjL10WpY-PKsmRgY1oz96HVtT5IPbF2tbYyMYPVE6YM4oCd2KfrU_LpyXUcBpWqAOFEJDIhiowYMTPpICRgVJETsULutrvY44iD0FSPvEBViQA2k4v9Z72UkH-RaMIWMQXU5y3sgFwZ3OpJg9iE2Wp37GoNsvOKhnVFB_xAjZ_mDHr0Jf0WvwUELSpkC1DdGTBgTl_HFT9_-_q_NS3g3cKhxXQBZ-kyjZWW7uFRkzZhD1nOTwiZtG5IMwulOayFcKo5_bwvVOOAXGpRPLKNovJi5Ewb4Jsq7RLQSQkroP1K29PyrYgjZPmz_ds0nTmgDDeN3u_ik7q0gNcCEKu3fyxeFdmG6tDOsUskaZkqlD/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\nThanks to Giselle Galle for correcting these lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter(s): Davis Radric Delantic, Mays Carlton D\n\n\n\n\n\nAZLyrics\nG\nGucci Mane Lyrics\n\n\n\nmixtape: \"Diary Of A Trap God\" (2013)\nDecapitated\nMe\nCutters\nPablo\nI Heard\nCali\nKeep It Real\nPussy Wet\nShow A Young Nigga\nShe A Soldier\nHigh Power Cowards\nRecognize\nHalf\nNuthin On Ya\nNights Like This\nChoppers\nAll These Bitches\nVirgin\nStash House\nFall Back\nClub Swole\nCold Hearted\nRealest Ever Lived\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search",
