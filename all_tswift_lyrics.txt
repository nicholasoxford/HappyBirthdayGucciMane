Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Trap House"



In the Trap house, In The Trap House, In The Trap House
Gucci Mane Check It

[Hook]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the coach
Hood rich so I never had a bank account
Junkies going in junkies going out
Made a hundred tho (usand) In My Trap House
Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred tho (usand) In My Trap House
Bricks going in, Bricks going out
Made a hundred tho (usand) In My Trap House

I'm tired of selling bricks I wanna go legit
I wonder can I sell 11 mill like 50 Cent
Cause platinum ain't enough I got too many vices
I love to smoke weed love to shoot dices
Say my life style extravagant I talk cash shit
Bitches say I'm arrogant well god damn Gucci cockie then
But at the same time young hoes be jocking slim
Gucci ain't shit, Bitch I beg your pardon
I'm independent but I'm balling like a major artist
I stay high like giraffe pussy In My Trap House
Smokin' rubber cushie

[Hook]

Jumped out the whip everybody looking
Big clouds of smoke but ain't nobody cooking
(females) (Girl their go Gucci Mane
I want his autograph 'cause I'm his biggest fan)
Yellow hummvie with the yellow feet
Yellow diamonds the same color as chedda cheese
And I'm smoking on that purple shit
They call me temp service 'cause I'll work a bitch
Money long like Shaq feet
Running dough like a sprinter at a track meet
I heard he got that soft white
Extended clips make them busters get they mind right

[Hook]

In my trap house watchin Sports Center
In the kitchen cooking but I ain't cooking dinner
Splash it with the water whip it make it harder
17 for 'em the same number as Qunice Carter
Say I'm working with wit a mill or better
Married to the game me and ?? live together
Street smart niggah never listen to the teacher
You can catch me in the bathroom smoking reefer
Prices low like Wal-Mart
Bricks on I-9 get ya shopping cart
Knee deep in the dope game
I'm not a farmer but I'm known to push them collard greens

[Hook]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"That's All"



[Chorus]
In the club tryin to find me a bad ass broad
Gave her five for the pussy then I took her to the mall
That's all babygirl thats all
18 for the whole nine five for the half 
Came up in the hood sellin fifty dollar slabs
Thats all playboy thats all

[Verse]
When them bottles start poppin girls start jockin 
The girl so fine that I took the chick shoppin
Dueces on the old school smokin on the dro fool
Know that its a hit, my voice done hit the tool
Gucci mane frank nitty got it like 
That never seen a chick wit a body like that 
Shawty actin feisty too damn sheisty
Get wit Gucci mane baby u be so icy 
Can't lie baby girl you fine as hell
Will I hit it in the first date time will tell 
Baby says she like the way the top drop back
Never thought my home boy girl a jock like that 
40 on the braclet back to basic
A mill worth of ice in these playa haters faces
A mill worth of ice in Gucci mane good gracious
Got a slick flow and I think its contagious

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I ain't wit that flexin cat he investing
Tell htese playa haters to check my bds benz
Like Yao Ming man my money staked tall
I deal for half a mill nigga thats all
See a broad Gucci mane ill buy
The same dude u shop wit im his supplier

Gucci Gucci Gucci yours truly thats me
Hood rich or cocky I just might be 
Wit my chain so bright Ray charles might see
More ice on me than a game of hockey
If you want a mean dick you can ride my six
Suck a good dick then ill get your hair fixed 
Gucci brake bricks down used to sell fifties
Watch on my wrist man it cost a buck fifty
King of the city Gucciman Frank nitty 
Ill gives a bitch a dove if she let me touch her tities

[Chorus]

Gucci mane make you look lke you posed to look 
Gucci shoesGucci fit and a pocket book 
Let you party like a rock star, ride in boxcar
Have you gainin weight everyday eatin lobster
All your friends invited so u can bring a partner
Gucci in the hood sellin weed like a docter
Fifty dollar slab to a trunk full of holes
Never at the house cause im always doing shows 
Teamed up with big cat now they want to chit chat
Role to crash raod, flat shoals represent that
Gucci in the booth and my flows crazy 
Is it hot in here nigga or its just me
Have you at south beach fallin of Jet Ski
Smokin purple weed under shade of palm trees 
In Biloxi we could spend a hundred gees 
Ill play the crap table you get the slot machine

[Chorus]

"Booty Shorts"



[Chorus] 
Put on your booty shorts 
Ooh, I really like the sexy way you walk 
Ooh, I like the way you make your booty talk 
Everytime you put on your booty shorts 
Believe dat girl

[Verse] 
I don't holla at girls girls holla at me 
I don't throw dollars at girls, they throw dollars at me 
Gucci you conceited bitch I might be 
Cause my chain so bright Stevie Wonder might see 
Yea you got a man but ya man ain't me 
Add ya whole life savings times three 
The mouth full of dro and the clothes ain't free 
So you gotta be a dimepiece to approach me 
How much 'unh can one girl take 
How many cakes can one man bake 
Playa on the real man I don't know 
I just love it when they fresh and they ass cheeks show 
Everybody stare when I walk in the room 
Smokin on purp got me high like the moon 
Chain front big like its New Year's Eve 
But my Rollie on fire like the first day of June

[Chorus]

[Verse] 
I neva seen a chick wit a body like that 
Gucci Mane Lil Flap bitch I got it like that 
Stuntin in the club wit my nigga Big Kap 
Made the waitress come back wit 20 mo' stacks 
Iced out chain got a iced out grill 
Independent I ain't got no deal 
Hood rich bitch do ya know the feelin? 
My watch worth damn near a quarter million 
Shawty got some shorts on oh, so small 
Say she like me cause my rims real tall 
If you want work bitch you can call us 
You in big wheels baby we some ballers 
Money ain't a thang to the boy Gucci Mane 
Old school Chevy same color cocaine 
Ridin through the hood throwin money out the brain 
And I'm lookin for the girls wit the booty shorts mane

[Chorus]

[Verse] 
Candy Escalade 26 inch blades 
Throw back money from back in eighth grade 
Ya dancin in the club so I know ya get paid 
But I betcha you'd look betta wit these microbraids 
Girls in the club like dat there stank 
Showin off three or four rubberband banks 
Me and HB keep a big bankroll pulled up in a Hemi wit the Lambo Doors 
Me and yo chick in a red corvette 
I neva had shit nigga what ya expect 
Neva seen a young man paint so wet hood rich and my album ain't even dropped yet 
You'll neva see a man wit a watch like mine 
Face real pretty and a body real fine 
When we get home I'm a break her spine 
Get in her ear and corrupt her mind

"Icy"
(feat. Young Jeezy, Boo)



I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy 

[Chorus:]
All these girls excited 
Oooo ya know they like it 
I'm so icy, so icy 
Girl don't try to fight it 
All yo friends invited 
I'm so icy, so icy 

[1st Verse: Young Jeezy]
Got a house around my neck, and my wrist on chill 
Any given time, 250 in ya grill (a quarter million?) 
All I do is talk shit, u can even add a couple grand for my outfit 
U betta act like ya know man, in my hood they call me Jeezy da Snowman 
Ya get it? Get it? Jeezy da Snowman 
I'm iced out, plus I got snow, man 
Let it marinate, y'all niggaz is slow man (slow man) 
(Man what the fuck y'all...yo dumb ass) 
I used to get nineteen for a beat 
Call me Ginuwine, the same 'ol G ('ol G) 
I'm da shit biiiaaattch, I need toilet paper (daaaaaayyuum!) 
And some air freshener nigga, fuck a hata 
These niggaz don't like me 
I'm wit da Gucci Mane and I'm so icy 

[Chorus]

[2nd Verse: Gucci Mane]
She diggin my fit, she think I'm da shit 
Is this a chain on my neck, or the watch in my wrist 
Maybe the ice in my ear, or my bracelet 
But she look like the type that could take a dick 
Young Gucci Mane, don't kiss me baby u can kiss my chain 
Ya gotta be a dime piece, 
just to look at the rocks in my time piece 
I come through in a drop top Jag, or Old-School Chevy 
wit da antique tags 
My pockets so heavy that I can't walk steady 
Niggaz coppin ice we done done it already 
Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie 
I ride big Chevys cuza nigga ain't petty 
I'm icy, so muthafuckin snowed up, lil kids wanna 
be like Gucci when they grow up 
Me, jeezy and Boo 
We ain't hatin pussy nigga 'gon and do what u do 
Cuz we icy, so icy, we icy, so icy 

[Chorus]

[3rd Verse: Boo]
I'm hoppin out the range wit da seats piped out 
You can still see my chain even when da lights out 
Cuz dat's how monsters do it 
Spit a lil game give 'em that flosser music 
I'm da man from da C.H.I. 
These lames runnin 'round thinkin they so fly 
Got a lil buzz but Boo been too high 
I'm pullin hoes in da club and I don't even try 
I guess when she glance at my wrist, she wanna get my dick 
I tell her holla at Jeezy if ya wanna pop Cris 
Get at Gucci Mane cuz he on some lil shit 
And you know I'm in da cut, grippin my 4/5 
Like let a nigga trip, naw we ain't runnin 
We just takin all ya chicks, buyin drinks gettin blunted 
Groupies, show you how to do this son 
We throwin out hundreds while you savin them ones 

[Hook:]
I got so many rocks, on my chain and watch 
I know I'm da shit, my chain hang down to my dick 
I know I'm da bomb, just look at my charms 
I know I'm da shit, my chain hang down to my dick 

[Chorus]

I'm so icy 
Look at my charms 
My...chain...hang...down...to my dick

"Money Don't Matter"
(feat. Torica)



We gon do it like this yall
We gon do it like that yall
We gon do it like this yall (put yo [?] in the club)
We gon do it like that yall (why nitti on the track)

All the money don't matter to me (to me)
And all the ice don't matter to me (to me)
Your girlfriends don't matter to me (to me)
Any nigga don't matter to me (ayyy)
Cuz I don't need to fly to you 
But yous the baddest chick I eva see (badest chick I ever see)
Come play on gucci team 
Every good king needs a queen (needs a queen)

The way you walk is, so sexy
The way you talk is, so sexy
The way you move is, so sexy 
Everything about you girl (everything about you girl)
My eyes deceiving me
She wants to be with me
She wants to sleep with me
Gucci needs two or three

I keep ya icy (so icy)
I have ya supa fresh (so fresh)
I know ya like me
You like the way I dress

Lately in love with me 
I'm in light wood
The game me so head
I spit one night worth
Keep a college girl past her curfew
Says she like me and she like her too
Get a bitch suck a dick what she gon do?
Point at the house had ta point it on you
Tell your girlfriend & your best friend too
You can bring a whole dorm and they can have some fun too

All the money don't matter to me (to me)

Gotta move the blow but its on the d-low
Thats what they made the train and the greyhound for

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Lawnmower Man"



[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Don't let yo' mouth write a check that yo' ass can't cash
I'm the lawnmower man and yo' ass is grass

Gucci Mane make a nigga wear a shit bag
Actin bad like a kid at Six Flags
I'll send some slugs at yo' bitch ass
In my hood ain't no love for yo' bitch ass
Fifty pounds in the trash bag
Anybody move then that nigga gettin blast at
Hit a lick for 'bout fifty stacks
Niggaz trippin talkin 'bout Gucci bring the money back
Half a brick and I'm breakin that
I'm in the trap where the junkies at
I'm gettin fat, fuck a jumpin jack
Zay' drop a track the whole industry be jockin that
I'll put a hole in your stocking cap
Work ya like a bitch at the Body Tap
I stay strapped, blow you off the map
Niggaz hate behind my back, but when they see me give me dap

[Chorus]

Uhhhh...
I'm from the hood I'll punch your lights out
I took your jewelry, now I'm iced out (icy icy)
Gucci Mane got that 'caine in
I swear I never tuck my chain in
You just a thug gettin traded
I'm a thug entertainin
Really I'm a street nigga
That chopper on the seat, nigga
All ready for that beef, nigga
Yo, Gucci gotta eat, nigga
I guess I'll see you when I see you nigga
I wouldn't wanna be you nigga
Now ain't that like a nigga
Tryin to sound like a nigga
A lover not a fighter nigga
But let me see yo' lighter nigga

[Chorus]

You see the bracelet on my arm, my necklace, my charm
I'm dangerous and armed with grenades and bombs
Y'all done slumped out with tons of ones
In tha club puttin on like "I'm Dapper Don"
Yours truly, young Gucci all I do is hustle hard
Never had credit but used my 2000 Mastercard
Grimy and gritty, hotter than cookin with lard
Gucci Mane on the block again and I'm cookin ya boys
It's that grown man shit, nigga bring all the toys
When I snap they'll have to call the lieutenant and sarge
Bring the whole entourage, see she thinkin you hard
And watch how quick I load the chopper bullets you gotta dodge
Uhhh... Gucci Mane on the track nigga
Zaytoven on the track nigga
Big Cat, Laflare nigga
I'm the lawnmower man, nigga

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Gucci Mane (Gucci Mane)
Big Cat, Laflare (Big Cat, Laflare)
Let's get it (let's get it)

[Chorus]
Half a brick in a pyrex pot
Trying to make me a dope boy knot
Two pounds and I'm like real big
Stacking double see the nigga so big
I got to get it, got to get it, got to run my money up
Got to get it, got to get it, got to run my money up [3X]

Uh! I'm going on a Trap-A-Thon
Gucci Mane like Gotti I'm the Dapper Don
Uh! Hundred G's in my Gucci bag
So if you look at me wrong I'ma do yo' ass
Uh, Gucci Mane, I'm the bread and butter
Run trap, sell crack, nigga spread your hustle
Uh, pockets fatter than Oprah Winfrey
Gucci Mane I'm the baller of the fucking century
Uh, iced out like Babe an' them
I can sell mo' records than Shade an' them
Uh, Gucci Mane you're a cocky fella
I make it rain so you better get you umbrella
Uh, and my watch is on another level
Clusters of diamonds and they bunched together
Uh, why you talking so much shit?
Yo bitch, cause I'm so rich

[Chorus]

Okay somethin white like Michael Jackson
Bust the shit out the rubber then I start to trappin
Gucci Mane got the lone ticket
Run stack for the midget nigga fuck with me, uh
Shawty say he short a couple stacks
The diamond chain on my neck is doing jumping jacks, uh
Yo' money short like Spud Webb
Bend down nigga broke nigga need help, uh
My money talking like Dikembe
Gucci Mane I make a Friday out of Wednesday, uh
Mo dough than CVS
Still making moves, thuggin with S-Y-S, uh
All my shows better be whippin up
J's keep the ash scrubs when we pick it up, uh
And me and Cad in a Hum-Vee
Yellow diamonds got me lookin like a bumblebee, uh

[Chorus]

Gucci got a plug, for the square face
Got them quarter ki's, I call 'em chicken wangs
Got the gangster peas, I call 'em collard greens
We got them ex pills, we call 'em skitters mayne
Gucci on the grind, catch me at the spot
Got some cocaine jumping out the damn pot
Get some cool water, it's too damn hot
All I want for Christmas is the dopeman knot
Hustle harder, be smarter
We gonna eat when I bring it out the water
36 O's, for the 17
Five for the drive, 17-5

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Black Tee"
(feat. Bun B, Young Jeezy, Killer Mike, Jody Breeze, 4-Tre, Lil' Scrappy)



[Chorus: Gucci Mane (Lil Scrappy) 2x] 
I rob in my black tee 
Hit licks in my black tee 
All in ya house searchin for bricks in my black tee (Crank It) 
I kill in my black tee 
I steal in my black tee 
Im real so I gotta keep it trill in my black tee (O-kay-kay-kay) 

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane] 
You can catch me all in a nigga house wit a black tee 
Gucci Mane, lil flair got a million dollar mouthpiece 
Black Tee, black rag, even got a black mask 
Leavin out ya house, thirty pounds in my book bag 
Black 'lac, black tag, fin' to hit a lick again 
You a head bussa put yo hand wit yo fist den 
Franchise hate me, probly wanna kill me 
Remixed it wit Scrappy and now the hood feel me 
Fresh on the scene wit the all black shirt 
Gucci so gutta he'll steal money out ya purse 
Lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church 
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt 
Black tee, black beat, trappin on the front street 
Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat 
Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me 
Bubble gum wappin ass niggaz can't smoke me 

[Verse 2: Bun B] 
It's Bun B in his black tee & G in his black tee 
Reppin UGK and BAT in his black tee 
Pimp in his black tee, mack in his black tee 
Free Pimp C on the back of his black tee 
Gucci chain swangin on the front of his black tee 
Cadillac swangin, smokin blunts in his black tee 
Stunt in his black tee, Ball in his black tee 
It ain jus me pimpin we all got a black tee 

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy] 
And I got a 1-2 Bun 
Got 36 O's for the 2-1 
Jeezy bout them green guys 
Got H-town goin for the ten or fives 
Im talkin cornflakes 
Got inner tubes wrapped in black duck tape 
Say it again dawg to make sure that ya heard me 
Got my four-x black tee up under my jersey 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 4: Killer Mike] 
I got the all black Chevy on all black rims 
Keep a small black gat in my all black Tims 
On the all-black leather there's a all-black mack 
Tryin to snatch get ya black ass blowed the fuck back 
44 to ya torso 4 in ya hat 
Kick doja to ya house n put it to a cataract 
Gorillas wit banana clips goin monkey in the back 
They'll put yo ass in that black box, laid out flat 

[Verse 5: Jody Breeze] 
Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee 
Gucci on the front, Jody Breeze on the back street 
Chillin by a black Cadillac on sum black feet 
Scrappy in a Chevy watchin Scarface on the flat screen 
Told yall constantly, ride wit the pump wit me 
Yup in my black tee, wit the nine underneath 
I aint gotta keep tellin yall niggaz ima G 
Ima just cock back and leave sum blood on ya teeth 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 6: 4-Tre] 
Im s-stainless in my black tee 
Remainin in my black tee 
On the grind cause I like to shine in my black tee 
Diamond glistenin cross plus the background is a black tee 
Thieve then come back sprayin rounds in my black tee 
4-Tre, I want war in my black tee 
Fuck them, probly neva wore a black tee 
Workin in my black tee, smokin purple in my black tee 
Im lookin for twelve all out yo curtain in my black tee 

[Verse 7: Lil Scrappy] 
Fuck a white tee, I got my black tee and vest on 
Fuck a sturdy shot, I'm goin straight for the bread home 
I don't know why yall niggaz dropped move b 
Cause now Raheem'll show ya punk ass a tree 
Bust nuts in my black tee, sluts in my black tee 
Now I'm smokin nothin but blunts in my black tee 
Saw me in Valve then tried to fight me 
Jus the same monkey shawty don't take me lightly 

[Chorus]

"Corner Cuttin"
(feat. Khujo Goodie)



[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Corner cuttin, trap shakin
Booty hoppin, you hear that beat knockin
(Is that that beat knockin?) That's that beat knockin
(Is that that beat knockin?) Yeah that's that beat knockin

[Verse 1]
Silverados, sittin on 60's
Lamborghini do's, just for the bitches
(Just for the bitches?) That's for the bitches
(For them witches?) That's for the bitches
Dodge Magnum, paint it platinum
He got to hear me in it, so it's the fast one
(Is that the brass one?) That is the fast one
(That's the brass one) Nah that's the fast one
Bubble eye Hummer, with the chrome grill
Ask your baby mama, how that leather feel
(How the leather feel?) That's how the leather feel
(Yeah how the leather feel?) That's how the leather feel
Brand new 'Vette, with the Calvins
Red and black, same color as the Falcons
(As THE FALCONS?!) As the Falcons
(As THE FALCONS~!) As the Falcons

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
63M, check the tag, yessir
Under the hood nigga, it's a geek monster
(Is that a geek monster?) Now that's a geek monster
(IS THAT A GEEK MONSTER?) Now that's a geek monster
Old school Chevy, with the Gucci guts
It's that latter day, I'ma make 'em put it up
(Make 'em put it up) I make 'em put it up
(SHAWTY MAKE THEM PUT IT UP~!) I make 'em put it up
Paint drippin wet, like my girl pussy

(Is that that bubble kushy?) Yeah that's that bubble kushy
(Is that that bubble kushy?) Yeah that's that bubble kushy

[Chorus - 2X]

[Verse 3]
Every woofer on, I skated on chrome
Just the other day, I got my lights on
(You got yo' lights on?) I got my lights on
(You got yo' lights on?) I got my lights on
20 cars deep, everybody whippin
{?} run the mill, all in them 26's
(Is them those 26's?) Oh them the 26's
(Is them those 26's?) Oh them the 26's
Bubble out bill, with the frog face
Alligator seats, that's how them ballers play
(That's how them ballers play?) That's how them ballers play
(That's how them ballers play?) That's how them ballers play
Old school Chevelle, sittin high as hell
High as hell as I ride through the A-T-L
(Through the A-T-L?) Through the A-T-L
(Ride through the A-T-L?) Through the A-T-L

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Damn Shawty"
(feat. Young Snead)



[Intro/Chorus: Young Snead]
Dammmn shawty! Why you hatin so hard?
Cause my chain worth a mill? Are my rims too large?
Dammmn shawty! You can get it like me
Ay don't be mad cause I'm in the club throwin up G's
Dammmn shawty! That shit fucked up
Niggaz mad cause I'm hot and they ain't gettin no love
Dammmn shawty! I'm straight from the streets
Sticks and stones break bones, words motivate me

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci finally made it, niggaz player hated
When I hit the club I got twenty G's to play with
Bitch I'm the brick man, ballin like a rich man
Sippin on this syrup got me leanin like a kickstand
Recognize the pimpin, feel the real attention
Laflare Entertainment, I'm playin my position
Waitin on the bitches, holla at the bitches
Never worked for Church's but I served a lot of chickens
Got a lot of G's so I do a little trickin
Hoe take this lil' money bitch and go on about ya business
Every day is Christmas, every night is Valentine's
Ten in New York, it's nine Alabama time
Moved to A-T-L, the whole East Atlanta mine
Billion dollar deal, I signed on the dotted line
Gucci 'bout to pimp shit, lobster steak and shrimp shit
Big Cat, Laflare, you try and get your wig split

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
They say my chain so cold, but my watch too hot
My earrings bling, pinkie ring on fire
Twinkle twinkle, see the stars pass by
Gucci Mane ain't hot? Youse a God damn liar
Why ask why? Niggaz go Bud Dry
A case of Cristal and a black fo'-five
Hoes in the club like "Who is that guy?
Drinkin Cristal throwin money in the sky?"
His fit so sharp and his wheels so large
The rims keep spinnin but the car stay parked
Fo' bedroom with the two car garage
Gucci just copped, nigga I ain't got a flaw
Wet paint job and the automatic start
Semi-automatic if you try to play hard
Gucci Mane Montana, from East Atlanta
Bitch the diamonds in my chain same color bananas
Uhh

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"My Chain"
(feat. Black Magic)



[Gucci Mane:]
My chain!
My chain, my chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain?

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

I came to the club, just to floss my chain mayne
Catch another charge and I'm goin to the chain gang
... Oh I think I'm icy
Sold a hundred thou' eatin bologna [?] white streak
... Don't you see how bright it is?
City girls and country girls be tellin me how tight it is
... These girls they be choosy
Diamonds be so sparkly they thank my chain was movin
... My chain is off the chain
Stacked up me some money, budget off and bought a chain
... Check the way my chain hang
Gucci I don't gangbang, all I do is chain swang

Gucci you be shinin, Gucci you be shining man
Go on turn me on homes tell me who your diamond man
... My girlfriend actin lame
She say I'm actin different just because I got this chain
... Haters get your hater on
When they see them yellow stones, holla at'cha later on
My chain hang to my shoestrang
Like my watch and ring, but I know you love my chain
My chain hang to my ding-a-ling
I do my thug thang when I'm in the club mayne
When you heard "So Icy," you thought of Gucci Mane
I got that stupid money so I bought a stupid chain

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

[Black Magic:]
Yeah, my first chain I had to rob for it
Jesus piece, yellow diamonds sittin all in it
I'm on some Slick Rick shit, 2006 Mr. T
Diamonds so bright ain't no way you can't see the G
Look I don't dance, I just lean with it
Yeah my piece sick, every robber tryin to leave with it
I got that New York fitted on, full suit dickie on
Gucci link chain, blue stones in a nigga charm
Now watch me do it, do it with no hands
Drop twenty grand on that bezel and that band
Cause I'm the man, I-I-I'm the man
Got no wife, but my chain got my girlfriend

[Gucci Mane:]
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

"Hold That Thought"



[Intro:]
Zaytoven on the track
Zay-tiggy
Gucci
Gucci

So Watch Entertainment
Lets Go

[Chorus:]
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G.
But hold that thought
Its a Kodak Moment
But hold that thought
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Hot as piggly wiggly
Cant kermit the frog dog
[Repeat]

Early in the mornin
I aint even yawnin
Cookin up a cake
Like I'm doin a performance
When it come to flossin
I aint even talkin
Diamonds on my joint
Got my chevy moonwalkin
10 bricks on my Bart Simpson, just look
My watch, 35 pounds of kush
My ring, 36 oz's my nig
My bracelet, 500 lbs of mid
A Gucci wrapped tour bus
Yall hoes follow us
Party pack pills man
Hoes gonna swallow us
Naturally a loner
But love my kid
Mix the soda with the cola
I can buy me a friend
New swag somethin like
Trap House times 10
Ery nigga round me 
Bust heads, YA-Dig
Iced out grill 
I can't buy that bullshit
I'm wit some street shit,
Like a reverend in the pulpit

[Chorus:]
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G.
But hold that thought
Its a Kodak Moment
But hold that thought
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Hot as piggly wiggly
Cant kermit the frog dog
[Repeat]

Like ya boi Rip Ham
I got a real good jay (a real good jay)
1 gram for the 80
Thats some real good play
Got them Vince Carter quartas
Add soda and water
I'm not athletic
But Ima straight balla
The Spud Webb ticket
Wit the lamburg yay
And its jumpin from the free throw
Like MJ
Sees nothin pass by
Like Steve and Pass
Say boy you lightnin fast
On the Utah Jazz
Like Dr. J shorts
My work real tight
You got that Atlanta Hawks yay
It wont get right
Catch me on the rebound
Like Bo Outlaw
Ima Mikey Vick-it whip it
Cook it souf-paw
36 hoes-zos
Tryna make the end zone
Make no hard move
And use my cell phone
Worth scrabblin in the pot
Just like Steve Young
5 for the Keyshawn
7 for the Deion

[Chorus:]
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G.
But hold that thought
Its a Kodak Moment
But hold that thought
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Hot as piggly wiggly
Cant kermit the frog dog
[Repeat]

Gucci on fiya 
Like mojo crack pot
Fell ova a joint
Like back like crack rock
Money stupid dumb
Just like Cold Blood
Just Young Hot
I show no luv
Money getta like Cheeba
Minds like Fat
And my trap roll hard
Just like Shawty Black
Ima country ass nigga
Jus like Ace
Gotta fetish, for the stones
Jus like Fo' Trey
Money tall like Broah?
Yours like D?
And my patience very short
Just like Courtney C
Angie B, Russell P
But its your choice
My girl Angel pussy deep
Like Slick Man voice
Like Red 03
Man I got bread
My pocket on swole
Like HP fohead
Ima money go getta
So I contest
Gotta a hundred hoes jockin
Jus like Throw Back

[Chorus:]
They call me Chef-Boy-R.D.
But hold that thought
Its a Kodak Moment
But hold that thought
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Hot as piggly wiggly
Cant kermit the frog dog
[Repeat]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Freaky Gurl"



[Gucci talking]
she's a very freaky girl girl..
a very freaky girl girl..
Gucci I wanna very freak girl

[Chorus:]
Now she's a very freaky girl..
Don't bring her to mama..
first you get her name..
then you get her number..

Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..
Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer

She's a very freaky girl..
she get it from her mama..
first you get her name..
then you get her number..

Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..
Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..

[Verse 1]
Gucci let me set the record straight.
Hater you participate.
three girls wit me like I'm going on Elimi-date.
Say you got a man but you man ain't here.
The ice in my ear shine like a shandalere.
Jumpin' out the phantom.
Don't you think I'm handsome.
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion.
But you baby daddy ain't icy like the kid be.
Got you baby mama, front seat of my Ferrari.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Gucci.. Gucci man of flavor.. baby I'm that guy.
Girls eyeballs pop when they see when my lam pass by..
ah my money long as a limo.
Just to show off I put my wrist out the window.
I ride through the six.
little gish green bingo.
I fell off in the spot light.
ayy lets mingle.
Then the DJ play my new single.
The club got crazy.
All the girls went Psycho.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Gucci. Don't be conceited girl.
I know ya freaky girl.
I know ya secret girl.
But I'm gonna keep it girl
O you's a colledge girl.
Come be a Gucci girl.
O you's a Gucci fan.
Let's go to Gucciland.
And be your Gucci man.
Cause only Gucci can.
Drop a rag.
Pop your bag.
With a rubberband.
You diggin Gucci Gucci.
Let's do the oochi koochi.
O that's yo girlfriend.
Why don't you introduce me.

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Pillz"
(feat. Mac Bree-Z)



[Chorus:]
[Mac Bre-Z:] Is you rollin [x3]
[Gucci:] Bitch I might be [x3]
[Mac Bre-Z:] Girl he geeked up [x3]
[Gucci:] Bitch I might be [x3]
Yeeaaaaahhh!

[Verse 1:]
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy til your bitch came in
Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she aint really pretty but she got a nice body
Im geeked up thinkin this Buffie The Body
Aint your name lil Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson
Im off three double stacks and I'm lookin for that action
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin
Ridin in my drop but I dont know where I'm goin 
On two eighty five I keep ridin in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin like a pound of purple
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes and a cold orange juice cause I'm really really trippin
Went to the strip club and request that I'm da man
The next thing you know I was throwin rubberbands

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Shawty tellin me she aint neva suck no dick
Neva took a pill or neva ate a bitch
You a lie but I aint gonna get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you marry well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband aint Icy like me
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee
When dem dope man nikes and dem jore ass jeans
I dont pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
Imma the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves thats three
Aint no waffle house baby hell I cant eat
Gucci hood like your hoodman hes so extreme
Wearin doces in the club cause you kno the boy geeked
Top the top on that thang let you see my seats
We've been rollin rollin rollin we aint slept in weeks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Gucci Mane ? nigga get your mind right
Or a crys by the twelve like a case of budlight
Sell a cush by a bell so you kno might shit tight
See I'm 30 in the morning on a all night flight
Im high like Fabo hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gonna party
Got a party pack of pillz thats at least bout 40
Ill pour dem in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pillz call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pillz man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill thats a damn good deal

Ay wassup Gucci Mane. Why you sweatin so hard? Is you rollin or somethin.

Shit well baby I might be. But got damn what is you doin.
You jockin a playa. You ch-Chewy ova here right.
Look I aint K-Rab baby You know what I mean I'm not a piece of Bubblegum.
What I'm doin is not your business. But matta of fact while you ova here is you a waitress or somethin?
Cause the shit you got on make you look like you a waitress. So do what you do iight.
Imma give you this hundred dollars. Go get you what ever you drankin.
Bring me and click about ten of dem orange juices, five crunk juices nd we'll be straight how bout that.
And is you straight is you single or is you marry.
Cause I might be, Bitch I might be,
Bitch I might be, Bitch I might be YEEEAAAAAAAHHH

Pimpin is the topic, 
Money is the object, 
Hataz gon' make me pull my gators out the closet, 
Tailor made outfit, 
Hollerin at a thick chick, 
1 hour lata got her messin up her lipstick, 
All the best in my clique, 
How u hataz hate that? 
Ridin in a mayback, 
Headed to the racetrack, 
Sippin on konyak, 
Big fat dro sack, 
Seat layed back, 
And actin like I'm all that, 
Tell me what you call that? 
Tell me where yo broad at? 
Chillin wit a mack throwback wit a strawhat, 
Hataz mean mug me, 
Girls wanna hug me, 
Everything's lovely, 
Tippin on bubbley, 
Pull up at the club, valet park the car, 
Fell of in the club then I bought the bar, 
Girls choose me cause ima superstar, 
They takin snap shots of my entourage, 

24's on yo car yous a trap star, 
If you known to buy the bar yous a trap star, 
You got a watch on ya wrist yous a trap star, 
You got ice around ya neck yous a trap star 
[x2]

[Verse 2:]
I'm the grind man, pine man, 
Dro man, jive man, power man, die man, dope man, coat man, snow man, slick man, trick man, trap man, hit man, big man, 
Come and gucci man, 
Peal man, brick man, po' man, rich man, dub man, lick man, weed man, soft man, pimp man, boss man, stunt man,
Killa man, fresh man, next man, better wear a vest man, 
Yo boy, dough boy, 
Brought down to no boy, 
Neva been a hoe boy,

Dough boy, glow boy, lover boy, pretty boy, city boy, country boy, 
Neva been a monkey boy, 
Jack boys, crack boys, dope boys, trap boys, 
See me in the club,shawty call me throwback boy, 
Black boys, black toys, eatlin like the fat boys,

You got a watch on ya wrist yous a trap star, 
You got ice around ya neck yous a trap star 
[x2]

[Verse 3:]
I'm ridin through the city in a escalade, 
It's friday night the J's just got paid, 
Left the barber shop wit a real tight fade, 
Hit tha car wash let my rims get sprayed 
I'm fresher than fresh, 
I'm sharper that sharp, 
My rims still spinnin but my car is parked, 
It's after dark, we left the park, 
I gotta blunt of dro rolled up this far, 
Everybody know me I'm the a10c, ask my boy ZT, 
Too hot for radio or mtv, tell BET to come and see Gucci, 
Im a trap star, ghetto celebrity, pretty girls wanna get in bed with me, 
And these pretty girls wanna give head to me, but these pretty girls gotta bring bread to me. 

24's on yo car yous a trap star, 
If you known to buy the bar yous a trap star, 
You got a watch on ya wrist yous a trap star, 
You got ice around ya neck yous a trap star

"Drive Fast"



Yeah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci,
Yeah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, (So Icy, So Icy,)
Seytoba baby,

[Chorus]
I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow,
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow,
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow,
Let ya hair blow, Let ya hair blow,

I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow,
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow,
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow,
Let ya hair blow, Let ya hair blow,

[Verse 1]
I drive a sports car bitch, Put em Bapes to the gas,
If you scared go to church cus I'm finna drive fast,
Throwing cash out the brain of a '74 Oldsmo,
There no mojo he need to get some mo do, 
 Cornerstore, Amaco, bought a crist to flat show, 
Niggas want that wola shawty meet right by Grocian Road, 
East side up, put them E's in the air,
If you smoking Bubba Kush, put them trees in the air,
I'm smoking on that kush so it's stankin up my car,
They call me "twinkle twinkle" cus they know that I'm a star,
I told her come here then I didn't say shit,
Cus my ice talk for me, I don't need no broke bitch,

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Verse 2, Gucci fish, shoes, and a purse too,
Steala of yo chain, turn yo watch to Starburst too,
Put them Lemon Heads in yo ears,
Put them Fruity Pebbles in yo fingers,
Now you're envied by yo peers,
And I'ma get yo ass in shape,
All that Gucci Louie Chong got yo ass loosin weight,(leanin)
Gucci Mane got you straight, huh?
You know he got that cake,
Gave it to her first date,
I'ma ride down the block like a damn X Pill,
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels,
I'ma roll down the block like a damn X Pill,
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels,

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah Rose, red Mikey's wit Bapes,
On some pharaoh shit, bitches feedin niggas grapes,
I'ma buy some hot wings, but I could buy steak,
But I'm good wit a trout, bitch a model too fake,
They toyin on the beat, so you know they gone hate,
Had that Tony Tiger Kush, man that shit smoke great,
Got that water bumpin talented I think I can do it,
Drop me and yo body fill wit them other fluid,
Trappa slash rappa but a full time G,
Smokin purp wit my boys, bout 2 or 3 P's,
I'm a trappa slash rappa but a full time G,
Smokin purp wit my boys, bout 2 or 3 P's

[Chorus]

"Stick Em Up"
(feat. La Chat)



[Chorus]
Pull up in the old school with the hubcaps, got my black tee,ones, and my skull cap,
Stick Em Up,
Stick em up,
Stick em Up,
Stick em Up,
Stick em up,
Stick em up,
Stick em up, ye aint know
I aint come to play and I aint come to laugh, all I gotta say is nigga put it in da bag,
Stick em up,
Stick em up,
Stick em up,
Stick em up,
Stick em,
Stick em up,
Stick em up, ye aint know

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
You know the procedure, when u see a heater
Bullets rippin at ya, got ya runnin like a cheetah
Rob in my black tee, mob in my black V
Robbed the weed man, cuz the nigga tried to tax me
Ye aint gotta ask me,tell me where the stacks be
Hittin big licks got me ballin like an athelete
Used to take starter coats, moved up to bigger dope
Down for a kick do' (door), just to make my wrist glow
Steal from the rich, but I hang with the po' folk
Ball till ya fall, but dont ball til ya go broke
Gucci mane la chat, we in and out the trap fast
Leaving out yo house, 30 birds in my bookbag

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - La Chat]
Ok..Check that bitch that wake up early in the morning, looking for a victim
The first nigga look like dolla's, tryna holla, I'm gone get em
I got no time for relationships, I'm out to get that cheese
Even if I have to kill u bitch my son I got to feed
Im at the mall, I'm poppin tags with shopping bags so style
I found a duck that I can pluck, that nigga that asked me out
Whoa, hold up my nigga u must dont know I gotta get ya
You told yo boy I got a big ass, but boy my nine is bigga
Im waitin on him to pull up at the spot I see he clean
That boy sittin on them things, a iced out chain, and big ass rings
He said lets go to the movies, I told him lets go to the room
This nigga think he really got a freak, but mine is do the fool
We get to the room, I let him rub,i let him get a lil touch
I told him hold up stop, let me go to the bathroom freshen up
I went out the bathroom window, met with Gucci glock in purse
Kicked in the do', shot him in his head, took his cheese and left him murked..Im that Bitch!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane]
They say that I'ma cut throat, gucci never cut coke
Yea I'ma jack boy, known to run a drug sto'
Hang wit the thug boys, nicknamed the goon squad
First you gotta sign up, then ya get your goon card
Niggas scared to fuck wit me, dont wanna serve me
Shop wit ya wednesday, take from ya thursday
Splurge wit my comrads, gucci mane I'm hood rich
Nigga kill for ya, if u just buy him a outfit
Think like a mob boss, move like warranty
Got a half a mill safe, just to keep the bills paid
Burn em with a hot fork, taser on his nutsacks
I aint come to play, I came to find them big stacks

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Everybody Know Me"



Gucci Mane Big Cat

Growing up was real hard on my block
Cops and robbers I was never the cop
To be the cop was considered a joke
I'm the same little' nigga that taught your brother to smoke

But now-a-days man I stay on the news
My every move is up on the tube
Whoever said being a gangsta was easy
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy

To be a gangsta is a full time job
A bad a boy but I ain't Black Rob
The pays good but the hours are crazy
You disrespect me I'm gonna see ya degraded

I'm never scared but I'm thinkin ahead
because they don't bury the scared man they bury the dead

I'm ex-con but I'm out on bond
Wave bye to the bad guys, Teflon Dons

[Chorus]
Got my name in the paper and my face in the news
Gucci Mane, Lil'flare
Everybody Everybody know me
Everybody know me nigga
Gucci mane, Lil'flare I'm a real OG (nigga) [2x]

Take it to the street nigga, lets go there
There ain't nothing 'tween us pussy nigga but air
But you better prepare 'fore you fuck with the flare
I'll have you role round, frickin up with the chair

See I don't fight fair na I don't fight fair
Gucci Mane'll put that ass in intensive care
Matter of fact if ya see me fight a grizzly bear, I suggest you help the fucking grizzly bear

Tha ain't no pussies ova here, na it's just Jeez
There ain't no time for no talk, nigga cock it and squeeze
Got these ho type ass niggas weak at the knees
Shoot two twenty-threes they'll chop down trees

Gucci Mane outta jail man, what I'm gonna do now
That Jeezy Little bitch ass thinkin out loud [2x]

[Chorus]

You mother fuckers must don't know who they mess wit
I'm that outlaw wild wild west shit
I'm on that two clipse AK and a vest shit
You motherfuckers must don't know who you fucking with

I'm not a kid, Gucci Mane full grown
So bring the choppers, leave the nines at home
And call the coppers cause I'm aiming for domes
I have ya call full backup on the phone

The franchise, but Gucci Mane ain't wearing no white tee
The niggas hate the fact that niggas so icy
but fuck that, niggas don't gotta like me
Cause seeing niggas shit'split in excite me

Picture me high off the weed like a kite be
I took ya bitch through my hood just to site see
I screen niggas so I stay on the skreet shit
and if there's drama then it's you I'm gonna deal with

[Chorus]

"We Live This"
(feat. Black Magic, Young Snead)



[Intro]
Yeah! It's ya boy Black Magic
My nigga Young Snead, let's go

[Verse 1]
Ay man I walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Since I moved to the South, my slang got colder
Walk got pimper, cane with the limper
Treat my bitch right, always lobster and shrimp her
Flatbush Ave I'm the number one contender
Simpson Road fashion, poppin wheelies on the Ninja
Whip game hot, flow cold like the winter
Ball hard if niggaz got blocks like a center
Time for me to switch it up, bigger car bigger truck
Got the new house and that too was big as fuck
And this a must that you see me blow
Lil' nigga hold the weight like my CEO
Now it's back to the business, we eat sleep and shit this
Take this, shoot him and any fuckin witness
Always on some pimp shit, never on some simp shit
At Big Cat Records nigga e'ryday is Christmas

[Chorus]
We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Big whips, big chips, we live this
Smoke kush, pop Crist', fuck bitches
Us young niggaz out there handle our business
We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Big whips, big chips, we live this
Smoke kush, pop Crist', fuck bitches
And send them goons if them goons on our shitlist

[repeat 2X]
Guess what I heard? Gucci Mane back
Guess what I heard? Man he reppin Big Cat
Guess what I heard? Young Snead on some other shit
Tell them fuck niggaz they can miss us with that sucker shit

[Verse 2]
I'm addicted to the trap, down with Big Cat
and you know he got a strap, why you wanna try me?
And you know I gotta scrap, you a country boy
so you know I gotta trap (AYYYY!)
Cop the fruity watch just to hurt the haters' faces
Big Cat chain with the Big Cat bracelet
Big Cat bracelet with the Big Cat bracelet
Countin twenty mill' in the Big Cat basement
I heard, I heard, word on the street
Gucci fell down now he back on his feet
Anti-social, he don't really socialize
What'cha call that? I call it street certified~!
A hundred thou' sold no lie
So call the fire truck, cause Gucci on fire
And he pulled up in a 'rrari
And if he hurt your feelings when he did then he sorry!

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Verse 3]
I'm a certified pimp shawty, never seen me cake a hoe
Bad bitch one night, next day another hoe
A young'un with a bankroll, listen what I date 'em fo'?
Benefits and everythang that I can go and break 'em fo'
We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Smoke kush, pop Crist', real pimp shit
Big chains, big whips on 6's
I got money on my mind so fuck bitches
I'm in the Coupe with the top back, Lamborghini do's on it
Had to do it B-I-G, so I throwed the 4's on it
Tote a fo'-fo' so the kid scream 'Fuck a hater!'
All black, long part, somethin like The Terminator
Call me the exterminator, sprayin like the Orkin man
You don't want no part of that we deeper than a marching band
We trap, we slang, we hustlers
And stay away from you motherfuckin busters

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Guess what I heard? Gucci Mane back
Guess what I heard? Man he reppin Big Cat
Guess what I heard? Young Snead on some other shit
Tell them fuck niggaz they can miss us with that sucker shit

Ya boy, Gucci Mane speaking

If yuh know wut I mean
I keep court side seats like I play fo' the team

I'm killin' maself
Hold ma dick wen I rap 'cause I'm feelin' maself
Real talk yuh's uh blow pop
Get outta jail na, ya whole show stop

Yuh's uh blow pop homie
I'm independent ballin' major yuh get no pops homie

And I ain't got time to be fucking with no blow pop

Uh blow pop, that's uh straight up busta
I call 'em blow pops 'cause them niggas suckas
I call 'em blow pops 'cause them niggas suckas
I call 'em blow pops 'cause them niggas suckas

They hatin' on Gucci Mane, that's uh blow pop move
Yuh gotta wear 20's just to fill ma shoes
See, I ain't fuckin' with blow pops
Yuh let uh, niqqa click and na yuh, stuck with uh blow pop

Yuh thought yuh wuz uh
G yuh turned out to uh blow pop
Yuh bought uh

So blow pops try to kill me
Somebody set me up so tell me how am I guilty?
But I don't need no one else
'cause anytime I get in beef
I just call maself 'cause yuhs uh blow pop

Uh blow pop, that's uh straight up busta
I call 'em blow pops 'cause them niggas suckas
I call 'em blow pops 'cause them niggas suckas

And if I see yuh in the streets prolli, spit in ya face

They try to knock me off but aye, it ain't that easy

Mad 'cause ma watch cost da same as uh, Porsche truck

[Macboney & Gucci Mane:]
Is you rollin, is you rollin
Is you rollin, bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be, bitch, I might be

[Gucci Mane:]
East Atlanta slums, yeah, that's where I come from
Pop that bubble cush, and put some on your toung
Now everything was great, until your bitch came in
Bout the same time that thang get lit
Her face ain't too pretty, but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up, thinkin of bussin her body
Go back to your trailer, cause you look like Joseph Jackson
I'm on three double stacks, and I'm lookin for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid mane, I love the way you flowin
Riding in my drop, but I don't know where I'm going
On 2 85, I be ridin in the Serka
This side, I spend time drinking that purple
Gucci show time, in like 5 more minutes
I'm gonna cool on juice, cause I'm really really trippin
Went to the strip club, then requested I'm the man
The next thing you know, I was throwin rubber bands

[Macboney & Gucci Mane:]
Is you rollin, is you rollin
Is you rollin, bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be, bitch, I might be

[Gucci Mane:]
She always tellin me, she ain't ever sucked a dick
Never took a pill, or never ate a bitch
You a lier, but I ain't gon get upset right now
But I wish I had a lot of types of techs right now
You say your man a bitch, he might be
But I bet your husband ain't icey like me
Keep standing on BC, in my ash and black t
Got them dope man Nikes, and them Jordan jeans
Got paper, but I still keep that Threx on me
I'm the shit in East Atlanta, baby, ask about me
Pop 1, pop 2, 2 halves, that's 3
Ain't no Wafel House, baby, eat like KD
Gucci good like your hood, man, he's so street
Wearin doces in the club, cause you know the boy geeked
Drop the top on the thang, let you see my seets
We been rollin, rollin, rollin, and we ain't slept in weeks

[Macboney & Gucci Mane:]
Is you rollin, is you rollin
Is you rollin, bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be, bitch, I might be

[Gucci Mane:]
Gucci Mane LaFlare, nigga, get yo mind right
Order Krisp by the 12, like I'm kissin Bud Light
Sell cush by the bell, so you know my shit tight
7: 30 in the morning, then an all night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shaudy
So tell me where to go, like my name E-40
A rich rockstar, nigga, I'm goin party
Got a party pack of pills, that's at least bout 40A bomb in your hand like like a pack of jellybeans
Take 4 these pills, call me in the morning
50, 000 pills
Man, I'm so real
$3 for a pill, that's a damb good deal

[Macboney & Gucci Mane:]
Is you rollin, is you rollin

"Way We Crawl"
(feat. Young Ralph)



[Gucci Mane:]
We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall
This is just the way we craull
Candy painted cars on chroam
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

Ralph with the bidnis, trap boy easy
Pint like beasty, blazed like chearch bisket
Rhims like didgets
Offset 6s
Cartier lenses, 20,000 dollar bridges
Came to the club, me and 3 or 4 bitches
8 or 9 bitches, shaudy and shaudy sisters
But now I'm so loaded, the junkies think I'm kidding
Paint so wet, like the K stop spittin
Rims real big, like Jay-Z lips
When I hit the bar, bring 3 or 4 clips
3 or 4 chicks, bet you I hit
Spent 12 racks, Gucci Mane the bank man

We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall
This is just the way we craull
Candy painted cars on chroam
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

[Young Ralph:]
I'm just a work dealer, I still play with work
Barney never round me, I still play with Perks
Stop verses, make calls whenever I ride in
Lamborghini doors up, just dive in
King sized place, still with bubble cush
And the seets in my car feel like a cushen
These niggas mad cause I took off
Bring myself up, and brushed that dirty look off
Yeah, I ball hard, and spend a lot of cheese
Young Ralph and Gucci Mane, that's a lot of cheese
Piss yello diamonds, they'll make you freeze
It's a weather change, bet my neck will make you sneeze

[Gucci Mane:]
We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall
This is just the way we craull
Candy painted cars on chroam
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

[Young Ralph & Gucci Mane:]
Gucci rock the Gucci, Ralph rock the Luie
I can't even lie, the rimms get a lot of cucci
Ralph switched up with Gucci, and Gucci switched up with Prodda
Haters get ba-da, bitches get na-da

[Gucci Mane:]
We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall
This is just the way we craull
Candy painted cars on chroam
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

"Give Us What You Got"
(feat. 4Tre & Jody Breeze)



[Jody Breeze:]
Once the glocc go pop, your body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, fuck the cops
Gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

[Gucci Mane:]
Save yourself, we the niggas with them big triggers
Me and D, bringing the pain to you bitch niggas
Imma hit m with the chopper, man
The only thing that can save his home is an avlanch
I just make a phone call, one call, have all yo domes fall
38 with the long barol, all them tips hit yo head, crack, you bone naro
Niggas hating, but I'm still here
Won't hezitate to put a nigga in a wealchair
Or should I say a pie buss
I'm runnin deep on your street, with 9 gloccs
And they all got extended clips, pistol grip, pistol slip, you get pistol whipped
I make m take they clothes off, fuckin load the pistol, then shoot a nigga nose off
I'm in the hood, I never leave, bustin heads with Jody Breeze
I killa nigga on the spot, nigga
Fuck the body, cause I'm aimin for the top, nigga

[Jody Breeze:]
Once the glocc go pop, your body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, fuck the cops
Gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

[4-Tre:]
I'm hangin with them real killers, cop pillers and drug dealers
Goin fill your ass up with bullets from the Skriller
No questions asked, see, I'm goin blast you
Jack The Ripper, I'm a real nigga splitter
I specialise in sweepin up game with Breeze, nigga
Let my work sizzle, I let the dope cook up, nigga
Dropping is great, so this cake, I get it
Tryna be slick, I rob then shoot your face, my nigga
I'm blast your mother, for thinkin I ain't
Have your brain slide the wall, like some brand new paint
And ride off in some brand new wet, go check, you bet we ain't in nobody det
If you o me, Gucci or Jody, we goin collect
Signed yourself, we goin have your ass on the stretch
Dissrespect the flex, put them thangs right to your neck
Tex, AK palm, these ain't no death threats

[Jody Breeze:]
Once the glocc go pop, your body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, fuck the cops
Gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

I walk around without a bodyguard, cause you niggas is not as hard
As you say you was, if you was, you wouldn't have to have a bodyguard
45 in my belt, try me, hoe
They goin find your legs on land, but the rest of you, it goin float
Get pumped, I'm put the rest of you in the trunk
Don't mess with the pump, less you wanna get pumped
Make m have to go down, I ain't scared of a dump, nigga
Leave you in the forest, like your last name gump
Jody Breeze and Gucci Mane, pull up in the Gucci van
With 2 or 3 rooggers, that's what we shootin, man
Hold up, nigga
Bitch, show nough, nigga
When I'm shootin, I'm aimin from your throat up, nigga
Cause you haters bout to make me put my glocc in yo face
Show you pussys what it's really like to ride the wave
So lean back, nigga, I mean that
Nigga, I squeeze back, trigger, cause I'm back, nigga
The bumper same color as the Indiana pacer, man
Redgy getting old, so I'm stikin with the purple, man
I'm the young thug that go up and down in here
If you rich, nigga, let me see you sign yourself

Once the glocc go pop, your body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, fuck the cops
Gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

"Hold That Thought"



[Intro:]
Zaytoven on the track
Zay-tiggy
Gucci
Gucci

So Watch Entertainment
Lets Go

[Chorus:]
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G.
But hold that thought
Its a Kodak Moment
But hold that thought
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Hot as piggly wiggly
Cant kermit the frog dog
[Repeat]

Early in the mornin
I aint even yawnin
Cookin up a cake
Like I'm doin a performance
When it come to flossin
I aint even talkin
Diamonds on my joint
Got my chevy moonwalkin
10 bricks on my Bart Simpson, just look
My watch, 35 pounds of kush
My ring, 36 oz's my nig
My bracelet, 500 lbs of mid
A Gucci wrapped tour bus
Yall hoes follow us
Party pack pills man
Hoes gonna swallow us
Naturally a loner
But love my kid
Mix the soda with the cola
I can buy me a friend
New swag somethin like
Trap House times 10
Ery nigga round me 
Bust heads, YA-Dig
Iced out grill 
I can't buy that bullshit
I'm wit some street shit,
Like a reverend in the pulpit

[Chorus:]
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G.
But hold that thought
Its a Kodak Moment
But hold that thought
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Hot as piggly wiggly
Cant kermit the frog dog
[Repeat]

Like ya boi Rip Ham
I got a real good jay (a real good jay)
1 gram for the 80
Thats some real good play
Got them Vince Carter quartas
Add soda and water
I'm not athletic
But Ima straight balla
The Spud Webb ticket
Wit the lamburg yay
And its jumpin from the free throw
Like MJ
Sees nothin pass by
Like Steve and Pass
Say boy you lightnin fast
On the Utah Jazz
Like Dr. J shorts
My work real tight
You got that Atlanta Hawks yay
It wont get right
Catch me on the rebound
Like Bo Outlaw
Ima Mikey Vick-it whip it
Cook it souf-paw
36 hoes-zos
Tryna make the end zone
Make no hard move
And use my cell phone
Worth scrabblin in the pot
Just like Steve Young
5 for the Keyshawn
7 for the Deion

[Chorus:]
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G.
But hold that thought
Its a Kodak Moment
But hold that thought
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Hot as piggly wiggly
Cant kermit the frog dog
[Repeat]

Gucci on fiya 
Like mojo crack pot
Fell ova a joint
Like back like crack rock
Money stupid dumb
Just like Cold Blood
Just Young Hot
I show no luv
Money getta like Cheeba
Minds like Fat
And my trap roll hard
Just like Shawty Black
Ima country ass nigga
Jus like Ace
Gotta fetish, for the stones
Jus like Fo' Trey
Money tall like Broah?
Yours like D?
And my patience very short
Just like Courtney C
Angie B, Russell P
But its your choice
My girl Angel pussy deep
Like Slick Man voice
Like Red 03
Man I got bread
My pocket on swole
Like HP fohead
Ima money go getta
So I contest
Gotta a hundred hoes jockin
Jus like Throw Back

[Chorus:]
They call me Chef-Boy-R.D.
But hold that thought
Its a Kodak Moment
But hold that thought
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Hot as piggly wiggly
Cant kermit the frog dog
[Repeat]

"Alligators"



Weighin it with the balance
Smokin on the Cali
The way a nigga valet, you think I'm doin ballet
Live my life ruthless, feelin real coupe-ish
Yellow feet, yellow Vette, and that bitch roofless
Suede guts in the Benz same color Scooby
Bracelet like 'I'm him' Jacob sayin 'Who he? '
Ring sayin 'What's up' Chain sayin 'Oohwee'
Grill say 'Drugged up' Tats say 'So street'
Underwear Burberry, Favorite fragrance Wall Street
Type of girl? Real thick, favorite color money green
Candlelight dinner gave her Cristal & x-pill
Wake up in the morning give her crab legs and oatmeal
Lobster tail and cheese grits, you ain't never seen this
Money tall like skyscrapers and I really mean this
Lobster tail and cheese grits, you ain't' never seen this
Money tall like skyscrapers and I really mean this

Long paper, tall paper
Stick to skrill like flypaper
Car look just like now and later
Shoes right there are alligators

Goin to my old school from bumper to bumper fool
Chunk a hundred stacks now we got more than?!?!? school
Just like my diamonds my car is so colorful
Rims pimped out, what the fuck I need Xzibit for?
I change lanes and I change hues from lime green to dark blue
Had it paint chameleon so they swang and they change too
Shine harder, grind harder, air ones look like tapwater, chrome rims look like silver quarters, got a see through top like bathwater
Dark green donks and the rims look like pickle juice
Twentysix inches sittin on the?
Sittin in the hottub with the shawty off the Bentley Coupe
Paint look like bloodred and the guts look like tomato soup

Long paper, tall paper
Stick to skrill like flypaper
Car look just like now and later
Shoes right there are alligators

Big ol' chain, and a big ol' Range
My '74 Olds got a big ol brain
Yellow vette same color as the Dom champagne
2007 centerfielder Gucci Mane
Damn Gucci Mane your car so clean, got 5 girlfriends like a b-ball team
Got a gasoline catalina listerine, got a clearcoat Chevy call that bitch chlorine
Wall street cologne cost $3000 bucks, on my first date went and got my dick sucked
Goddamn Gucci Mane you too damn much, lockin down the brake and I'm holdin the clutch

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Cuttin' Off Fingaz"



Geah [echoes], Gucci [echoes]
Gucci Mane, LaFlare, yeah
(A lot of niggaz thought we couldn't have pulled it off Gucci)
(But, guess what, we here, we sellin units)
(We doin real big AND we eatin, the whole plate)
The whole fuckin plate man; ain't no cuts on this shit man
Ain't no middleman in this shit, we want all the fuckin money man
We get all the money, independent where it's at man
I'ma tell y'all independents like this
If you want the blueprint to this shit, watch Gucci Mane

Gucci overdooz it, does it, the boy's perfect
Neck piece flooded, it's color scattered and covered
I'm worth nine hundred God damn I spent a hundred
But that's rap money, when trappin that cash nothin
I'm internet surfin, tourin grillin and turfin
Speedboat racin, jet skiing and golfin
Crazy color Jordans, same color the ballin
Bitch I bet up on it, I'm rich my dear regardless
Shrimp scampi odor every time I flaunt chick
Trap nigga conversate, with a Harvard smart bitch
I'm young rich and heartless, put you on a carton
Cartoon jewelry customized by my artist
Six months locked, got a head start bitch
I was nigga rich befo' I ever got a rap check
Yellow Corvette same color Moet
Paid twenty grand just to get every stone set

Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

I'm shittin on these rappers like I'm wearin a Pamper
I'm sittin on five hundred cause I got it together
Niggaz never try niggaz that set examples
I'ma eat a shawty sunnyside or the scramble
The port of Miami, to the streets of my 'lanta
The pinkie with the light stone match your encounter
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, they call me Gucci Montana
I'm Boston, Georgia, Florida, Macon, Tampa and 'Bama
My Mississipi niggaz feel me harder than Banner
Haters see my video they switchin the channel
Gucci got pieces, shawty go get'cha camera
And Gucci time is money bitch, so go get it faster
Cause I could give a damn about your father's a pastor
Because I smoke your father then yo' ass is a bastard
Gucci smokin weed, so you know he's a hazard
Money's on my mind, bitches don't really matter

Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

My money so big it can't fit in my matress
Devil bought the actress cause I signed with Atlantic
One fifty cursin while trappin in Spanish
Forty in my pocket turn yo' head to some Manwich
Boss of your boss man, I push the Porsches
My million dollar chain got me feelin important
Jumped off early and copped me a fort
Major moves with money like the (King of New York)
Gucci go and get it while them hoes get abortions
Shittin on a bitch, take a piss on they Jordans
Rappers want promotion, Gucci Mane want the package
The scale in the bag, bitch pay me on the back end
Hamiltons and Washingtons, Franklins and Jacksons
Trapper never trip, I just added the fractions
New bitch waggin, brand new mansion
And everything designer from my jeans to my glasses

Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

"Freaky Gurl"



[Gucci talking]
she's a very freaky girl girl..
a very freaky girl girl..
Gucci I wanna very freak girl

[Chorus:]
Now she's a very freaky girl..
Don't bring her to mama..
first you get her name..
then you get her number..

Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..
Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer

She's a very freaky girl..
she get it from her mama..
first you get her name..
then you get her number..

Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..
Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..

[Verse 1]
Gucci let me set the record straight.
Hater you participate.
three girls wit me like I'm going on Elimi-date.
Say you got a man but you man ain't here.
The ice in my ear shine like a shandalere.
Jumpin' out the phantom.
Don't you think I'm handsome.
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion.
But you baby daddy ain't icy like the kid be.
Got you baby mama, front seat of my Ferrari.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Gucci.. Gucci man of flavor.. baby I'm that guy.
Girls eyeballs pop when they see when my lam pass by..
ah my money long as a limo.
Just to show off I put my wrist out the window.
I ride through the six.
little gish green bingo.
I fell off in the spot light.
ayy lets mingle.
Then the DJ play my new single.
The club got crazy.
All the girls went Psycho.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Gucci. Don't be conceited girl.
I know ya freaky girl.
I know ya secret girl.
But I'm gonna keep it girl
O you's a colledge girl.
Come be a Gucci girl.
O you's a Gucci fan.
Let's go to Gucciland.
And be your Gucci man.
Cause only Gucci can.
Drop a rag.
Pop your bag.
With a rubberband.
You diggin Gucci Gucci.
Let's do the oochi koochi.
O that's yo girlfriend.
Why don't you introduce me.

[Chorus]

"Benchwarmers"



Gucci make money
That's what you call money
Small money mall money you ain't got no money
Black cars stupid guwap got that white folk money money
Six day work week smoke break on Sunday
So country country cash out hundreds
Dropped 70 on my Hummer but that ain't bout nothing
So country country cash out hundreds
So country country cash out hundreds
Dropped 70 on my Hummer but that ain't bout nothing
60 g's on the Vet but that wasn't no stuntin'
Bart Simpson chain appraised at a clean 100
Mighty mouse charm appraised at just 50
Have it shine like Diddy's
Cross em up like Bibby
Many men wanna kill me but I'm not 50
I'mma take one with me let me know who with me
Who you with mutherfucker blood in no envy
When the fed's snatched me I said I had no memory
I'm tha hottest thang to hit patchwerk this century
Used to have a 10 speed now I'm riding a bentley (yeeeeaaaa)

This for the bench warmers
Get off the bench and try to be a starter
The water boys just go and get the water
Damn you a reflection of your father (yeah)
This for the bench warmers
Your daddy say he wish he had a daughter
Damn you a reflection of your father
I bet that you wish you was a baller (GUCCI)

Gucci godfather, flow just like water
Never bought s-dot carter's
I rock with a new jack swag so I rock more harder
One thang I never do is kiss my partner
No kunta kinte more like shaka (shaka zulu)
We don't shoot arrows we shoot chopper's
No voo-doo priest psychic or which doctor can predict
When gucci gone get off ya
La costra nostra
Glock's and holsters
Roaches, witches, rats and vultures
To get it out of victim we might use torture my
Saucers got million's so I keep lawyer's
You derail us, we'll destroy ya
Big boss man, Never been no worker
Mojo gettin paid just to roll up purple
Gotta be a boss to get in my circle
Got to get it off or the click might murk ya
You gotta be a boss to get in this circle
You gotta get it off or my click might murk ya pussy!

This for the bench warmers
Get off the bench and try to be a starter
The water boys just go an get the water
Damn you a reflection of your father (yeah)
This for the bench warmers
Your daddy say he wish he had a daughter
Damn you a reflection of your father I bet that u wish you was a baller (GUCCI)

What's up Jeezy and what's up Kiki
Them weak ass niggas couldn't hurt my pinky
Trying to kill the kid nigga, what you thinking?
Stop Gucci breathing you must be dreaming
Somebody pinch me cause I'm not sleeping
Black man found slain and I'm not weeping
No surrender, Fuck retreating
Spies in the operation, I smell treason
I never killed the man cause I had no reason
Dope game hard and you still hadn't Meechie
I never killed the man cause I had no reason
The dope game hard and you still lil jeezy pussy

This for the bench warmers
Get off the bench and try to be a starter
The water boys just go an get the water
Damn you a reflection of your father (yeah)
This for the bench warmers
Your daddy say he wish he had a daughter
Damn you a reflection of your father I bet that u wish you was a baller (GUCCI)

"Hit Another Lick"



Old face hunneds (yeah)
New face 20's (yeah)
Damn Gucci Mane just took my money (yeah)
I sell alotta pies
I robbed a couple guys (yeah)
I'm stuntin' like a bitch cause I hit another lick (yeah)

New face 20's (yeah)
Damn Gucci Mane just took my money (yeah)
I sell alotta pies
I robbed a couple guys (yeah)
I'm stuntin' like a bitch cause I hit another lick (yeah)

When I started stealing candy I was just 6
My momma's close friends said I'll never be shit
8-7 nigga I was taking kid's shit
Started jacking shawty, let me get that bitch
1989, I was only 9
I wasn't slanging keys I was tuckin for a dime
Mountain Park apartments, everybody on the grind
Sun Valley apartments, everybody got a 9
It was 1992, and I was just 12
Had a run in with the law and they put my ass in jail
Juvenile, 50 g's, got me in a hour
12 years old with the money and the power
I was 14 selling flour and powder
Made 80 bucks a hour counting up product
I was 14 selling flour for powder
80 bucks a hour
Counting up product

Old face hunneds (yeah)
New face 20's (yeah)
Damn Gucci Mane just took my money (yeah)
I sell alotta pies
I robbed a couple guys (yeah)
I'm stuntin' like a bitch cause I hit another lick (yeah)

Old face hunneds (yeah)
New face 20's (yeah)
Damn Gucci Mane just took my money (yeah)
I sell alotta pies
I robbed a couple guys (yeah)
I'm stuntin' like a bitch cause I hit another lick (yeah)

I was 14 bringing a,.38 to school
A deuce deuce in my locker and was known to cut a fool
I always packed a tool
I always played it cool
Drive a Chevy Caprice bought sell t9's and paint it blue
Matter fact that bitch was purple it would be, like a fool
That was 1998, I just stopped goin' to school
Brought a brick
Hit a lick
Then I got my new tattoo
Gucci held in the mic, tell them pussies what to do
One time I hit a lick, and I didn't know how to act
I start laughing when they asked me to bring the money back (hahaha)
One time I hit a lick, and I didn't know how to act
I start laughing when they asked me to bring the money back (HA)

Old face hunneds (yeah)
New face 20's (yeah)
Damn Gucci Mane just took my money (yeah)
I sell alotta pies
I robbed a couple guys (yeah)
I'm stuntin' like a bitch cause I hit another lick (yeah)

2002, a nigga had to do (what?)
What he had to do
That's why I robbed you (true)
2003, you know I needed weed
I knew you had them ki's
That's why I took yo cheese (that's why I did it)
2-K fo', I round a nigga do' (what)
I layed him on the flo'
Then shot him in the nose
They taking off they clothes
I'm workin all foes
I spanked his mammy house, Now he let it go
The game unfolds
I'm jumping out a Rolls
I robbed so many niggas that I rarely use my phone
My pistol bought a home
My pistol bought a coupe
Yo pistol is for show, but my pistol bring me loot
Gucci

"Big Broke Records"



You big cat
You big pussy
I got big dough, we sell big kushy
You fat fucker
You fucking moulie
You big piece of shit
You tried to trick the Gucci
I fucked your girl (I fucked her)
While you was gone (I did it)
Then fucked your girl (damn)
While you was home (again)
She's home alone
She call my phone
She gave me dome
Won't leave me lone
I know all ya business, and all ya spots
Know how you move, let's fire some shots
You know all my business, and all my spots
You know how I move
Let's fire some shots
I came to this fat fuck chained up
Ranged up gangbang nigga I was flamed up
Big Broke Records
Bankrupt Records
If I wasn't trappin' I would be special
Gucci like to shoot
Gucci like to murk
Cat snitched got 14 months damn (true)
Mella yes man (true)
Sucking Cat's dick (true)
Big Cat Ms. Davenport
Can join the list (so)
She another black bitch (so)
Ain't worth 2 cents (true)
Now ya'll mad that ya'll broke and I'm rich
And ya'll ain't worth 3 cents
Just like shawty shoot the studio up
Beyoch!

It's hot as a bitch but I gives a fuck
I swag through the 6 with my pistol tucked
Brick boy click put your pistols up
So Icy on my tag nigga eat my dust
I'm high as a plane and in God I trust
A nigga try us then his head is bust
I'm smarter than you nigga that's how I got my bucks
Niggas sending threats like we gives a FUCK
Nigga probably mad cause his budget cut
And I'm in the 6 screaming "Bricks R' Us"

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Lawnmower Man"



[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Don't let yo' mouth write a check that yo' ass can't cash
I'm the lawnmower man and yo' ass is grass

Gucci Mane make a nigga wear a shit bag
Actin bad like a kid at Six Flags
I'll send some slugs at yo' bitch ass
In my hood ain't no love for yo' bitch ass
Fifty pounds in the trash bag
Anybody move then that nigga gettin blast at
Hit a lick for 'bout fifty stacks
Niggaz trippin talkin 'bout Gucci bring the money back
Half a brick and I'm breakin that
I'm in the trap where the junkies at
I'm gettin fat, fuck a jumpin jack
Zay' drop a track the whole industry be jockin that
I'll put a hole in your stocking cap
Work ya like a bitch at the Body Tap
I stay strapped, blow you off the map
Niggaz hate behind my back, but when they see me give me dap

[Chorus]

Uhhhh...
I'm from the hood I'll punch your lights out
I took your jewelry, now I'm iced out (icy icy)
Gucci Mane got that 'caine in
I swear I never tuck my chain in
You just a thug gettin traded
I'm a thug entertainin
Really I'm a street nigga
That chopper on the seat, nigga
All ready for that beef, nigga
Yo, Gucci gotta eat, nigga
I guess I'll see you when I see you nigga
I wouldn't wanna be you nigga
Now ain't that like a nigga
Tryin to sound like a nigga
A lover not a fighter nigga
But let me see yo' lighter nigga

[Chorus]

You see the bracelet on my arm, my necklace, my charm
I'm dangerous and armed with grenades and bombs
Y'all done slumped out with tons of ones
In tha club puttin on like "I'm Dapper Don"
Yours truly, young Gucci all I do is hustle hard
Never had credit but used my 2000 Mastercard
Grimy and gritty, hotter than cookin with lard
Gucci Mane on the block again and I'm cookin ya boys
It's that grown man shit, nigga bring all the toys
When I snap they'll have to call the lieutenant and sarge
Bring the whole entourage, see she thinkin you hard
And watch how quick I load the chopper bullets you gotta dodge
Uhhh... Gucci Mane on the track nigga
Zaytoven on the track nigga
Big Cat, Laflare nigga
I'm the lawnmower man, nigga

[Chorus]

"Iced Out Bart"



I got a iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me

I got a iced out bart where my heart at
Got multi colored diamond clothing
Shorty it's all that
New pinky ring
Zay, What do you call dat?
I call it Smurfette
Papa Smurf is the bracelet
VVS very very slight flawsless
$20, 000 just to get every stone set
Call my ex girl and she ain't hung that phone yet
I hit her best friend now she screaming she upset
Better watch out cause your girlfriend Nicole next
See I got a iced out bart where my heart at
She started it
Bitch did'nt know how hard the kid did what he did just to feed this damn bitch (It's Gucci)

I got a iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me

I put a diamond in the place of my heart, Zay
Even Jay-Z fell in love with Beyonce'
So, Niggas like me will fuck a hoe on the first date
Then scratch couple hundreds... It's nothing
I keep a bank roll ask your friend am I bluffin'
She den turn you on to the dick cause she cuffin'
She blushin'... Cause she know It's Gucci LaFlare
And when you got something good you wanna keep it to yourself (It's Gucci)

I got a iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Me And My Niggas"



Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain't tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle
[x2]

[Verse 1:]
You see cant catch meeee, gucci mane ain't runnin and i heard dey got pounds of weed
Got everythang you need from da X to da hard or soft nigga get served if you shop wit me
Got a team of cut throat niggas bout kickin doors clean off, when dey get dat word from me
Nigga please and my clique see 1 brick a piece den you gone get burnt to da third degree
Gotta two-twenty-three shootin bullets on da dot, a nigga finna get found by da birds and trees
Get ya ass dropped down on, by a nigga wit grill sayin get down on yo hands and knees
Give a fuck what anotha nigga got, who he shot, just long as da nigga dont fuck wit me
Ain't neva been a nigga trickin bucks just to fuck, cuz a slut catch a real nigga nut for free
Catch me on da streets of da southeast, gold grill and a million dolla mouthpiece
Deres a lot of hatin shit said about me, cuz I'm ridin twenty threes on a grand prix
Bitch check my family tree, ain't nun but Gs, ain't no pussy nigga finna handle me
You can try and see, I bet you D-I-E, cuz love bussin shots out randomly
Have you lookin at da eyes of a dead body, grab a choppa come back shoot errbody
Give a fuck what ya homeboi say about it, ain't a muhfuckin secret I'm dead rowdy
I remember when I first start trappin, talkin sun valley tryna make shit happen
Sellin reefa dude, tryna make a lil loot, you can ask D and coop cuz dey seen me in action

Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain't tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle
[x2]

[Verse 2:]
First we lost smiley den we lost dre, den we lost twon den we lost ayon
Now my boy von doin time for a murder charge, shit lookin bad so I gotta pray for em
Where we come from niggas die young, a nigga truly blessed if he turn 21
Ill neva turn my back on my niggas from da crest, and I put da momma and my unborn son
Crest where I'm from, dats real tung, straight up out da slum, and my word is my bond
I rob wit my gun and I con wit my tongue, if a nigga still breathin den da job ain't done
Everything we serve A-1, still sellin jays straight drop dat make dey mouth feel numb
Still throwin big barbeques at da park, if u ain't from my hood den yo ass cant come

Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain't tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle
[x2]

[Verse 3:]
Nigga gotta hustle nigga gotta struggle, makin power moves gotta use a lil muscle
Gotta keep a tool, you a fool, if you think dat da straight drop crew ain't gone mothafuckin buss you
Tight like brothas, talkin bout hustle, if we dont know you den we sho dont trust you
Just might touch ya, cuz we feel like fuck ya, deres a lot of niggas getting killed on custer
Bouldercrest road bitch dats my post, use to sell blow up at dat store
Lost a lot of homebois in da process, only lord knows who'll be da next 2 go
Gotta studio on Gresham road, dats where da Gucci mane disc gets sold
Dats where I stand on deese ten toes, tryna make my money come back ten fold
Gucci got da work my nigga 10-4, drunker den drunk sippin on glenmoe
Got 4 grams bout 2 we score, hit pryor street gimme bout 10 mo
Still got da hydro fo da low, order too big holla at chevro 
Straight drop clique tight like kinfolk, helpin each otha so we cant go broke

Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain't tussle touch or toungue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle
[x2]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Bling Bling"
(feat. Big Tank)



[Intro]
Gucci Mane in the buildng (Gucci Gucci)
Laflare entertainment (Laflare)
Zaytoven on the track (Zay Tiggy)
That nigga Dest in the buildin (that boy Dest)
Bad Boy in this motherfucker (Bad Boy)
Big Cat in this motherfucker (Big Cat)
Is Laflare in this motherfucker? (That boy Gucci)
Yuh

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I got your budget on my neck, your deal on my wrist
Your whole entire life savings on my pinky nigga
Bling bling bling bling (bling bling bling bling)
Bling bling bling bling (bling bling bling bling)

[Gucci Mane]
See I'm smokin on some bubba kush, come from California
Funky like yo' daddy feet is stankin like ammonia
Now I got his plug with this {?} in Arizona
When I touch Atlanta they gon' tell my telephoner
Trap niggaz, rap niggaz, wish they could clone us
Icy cause I dig blue blue big bails of marijuana
Trappin has advanced from just standin on the cornah
Violators haters will be turned to organ donors
Chillin in the V.I., sippin on Corona
I'ma get some head with this this bitch like this Patrona
Stop playing games girl cause I don't condone 'em
If you want some work don't come before like it's a zoner
Fifteen inches but my rims they some grown-ups
Sucker for a minute now a nigga has done blow up
Check my BDM's, look at my spins, daily goin up
Check, check my spins, daily goin up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Check I'm out the Folia, foolin with that Scorpion
It's mess when that bad chick stride off the rodeo
Smokin on the fire, got desire, do the holy crescent
If you ain't poppin no bottles right now (bruh ain't reppin)
I'm the freshest from dirty, Westside rollin close to {?}
From the alley, habits, might die from a overdose
On a mission my vision, clouded by the paper
Crooked, took it, cut it, shave it with the razor
Even miss my bread and butter, I ain't gettin offended
Run it not in my budget, I ain't got to share it
Who's your man? Like it, love it, not to want to play it
{?} on them thugs, money on the table
Who who play in the club? You fuckin with the mayor
I'll be damned, fresh in the mud, put you on the payroll
What'chu want? Say what you want, it's all about me
We get high and run in the hood, you fall around me

[Chorus]

[before third verse]
Big Tank, Big Cat
Let's get it in nigga
Uhh

[Big Tank]
I show you how to do this here, keep a light bluish ear
Sixty on them frightening, so you don't excite me
Haters don't like me, and I don't like you either
You mad cause I'm stacked up, and you underachiever
You see the plat' Amex, you still fuck with Visas
Vietnam, Cakalak, niggaz throw the V's up
Nigga roll the trees up, what the fuck you waitin on?
We talkin 'bout this money, so go on make a hatin song
Gucci's on my feet, but my jeans look like dollar signs
'cicles on my teeth, so I'm talkin money all the time
G's I'ma follow mine, you don't want no part of mine
Chopper in the back'll have you leapin like Impala signs
Big Tank, Big Cat, nigga what you know about it?
Sittin in the booth, and they told me bring the flow up out it
Go getter fo' sho' about it, money over e'rythang
Stackin up this paper 'til it's higher than a airplane

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Uhh

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Re-Up"
(feat. Yatta Mann)



[Intro:]
Yeah, that boy Gucci
Got my nigga block in this bitch
East Atlanta's finest 
E.C.T South!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Early in the morning Nigga Imma be up
Imma be up, Imma be up;
Call Block or Gucci Mane when it's time to re-up 
It's time to re-up It's time to re-up;
7:30 in the morning, Nigga we gon' be up 
We gon' be up, we gon' be up;
Call Block or Gucci Mane when it's time to re-up
It's time to re-up, it's time to re-up;

[Verse 1: Yatta Mann]
Boys what it do?
Nigga getcha g's up
Dope man bitch!
Call me Mr.Re-Up
The kitchen smells like fish, the fish scale dog
1000 Grams at a time on the Digiscale ow!
.45 Mac
Rubber band stacks
Spent a ? a mill wit Papi watch how fast I get it back
The dope boys love me
Taught'em how to cook
You whip it real hard, cold water, let it drop
The dope man bitch!
Sold bricks, sold rocks
100 thousand dollars, fell like I shot a cop
The dope man bitch!
Sold grams, sold white
Cook the work 10 minutes 
Fiends gave me 5 pipes
New York nigga's love how I work that turn pipe
Got Micheal Jackson yay 
Powder 10, but it cook white
I don't get nervous when I ride them highways 
Dope man bitch!
Everyday is my birthday!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got the city on lock!
Have you ever seen a ? million dollars in a Nike shoe box?
I can show you how to trap!
100 grand worth of cap
And I pray that my phone ain't tapped!
Nigga buy for the smell of it
Bought a hard top 6 and I sat it on spree's for the hell of it
7 on the dot!
Got some cain and its jumping out the pot!
I'm in the game so I give it all I got
To a million dollar spot
I got a rainbow Range same color as lean
Wit the matching rims on it, man that bitch so clean
Gotta skittle Drop Jag and a fruity Chevelle
If I drop the top back, bubble kush you gon' smell
Every flip I cop another whip
Every trap I cop another chain
Every play I cop another tool
What these nigga's know bout Gucci Mane?
Notta damn thang!
I'm icy, something like a polar bear
When your girl give me brain better hold her hair
100 Grand in the bag just to make you stare
Re-up wit the man
Gucci Mane Lil'Flap 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Go with our rental cars
Used to serve hard to Mountain Park;
Now I stand behind the burglar bars
Say Lil'Breeze best smoke ya gars;
I'm the hustler of the century 
When you think of money mention me
I said my buddy get it to the key
From Arkansas to Tennessee
Every Brick, Pill. And every "P"
Some how it doesn't come from me
I'm on T.V gettin interviewed
Still got them thangs in the intertubes
8 grand for the good purp
A t-shirt, under my t-shirt
Aye lock it up, that's a bad word
You had to whip it till your wrist hurt
You shoulda holler'd at Gucci or Block
Got'chu a dime to a ? a block
I'm knocked diamonds and I never stop
Disturbing cocaine; duckin cops

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Freaky Gurl"



[Gucci talking]
she's a very freaky girl girl..
a very freaky girl girl..
Gucci I wanna very freak girl

[Chorus:]
Now she's a very freaky girl..
Don't bring her to mama..
first you get her name..
then you get her number..

Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..
Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer

She's a very freaky girl..
she get it from her mama..
first you get her name..
then you get her number..

Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..
Then you get sum get sum in the front seat of the hummer..

[Verse 1]
Gucci let me set the record straight.
Hater you participate.
three girls wit me like I'm going on Elimi-date.
Say you got a man but you man ain't here.
The ice in my ear shine like a shandalere.
Jumpin' out the phantom.
Don't you think I'm handsome.
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion.
But you baby daddy ain't icy like the kid be.
Got you baby mama, front seat of my Ferrari.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Gucci.. Gucci man of flavor.. baby I'm that guy.
Girls eyeballs pop when they see when my lam pass by..
ah my money long as a limo.
Just to show off I put my wrist out the window.
I ride through the six.
little gish green bingo.
I fell off in the spot light.
ayy lets mingle.
Then the DJ play my new single.
The club got crazy.
All the girls went Psycho.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Gucci. Don't be conceited girl.
I know ya freaky girl.
I know ya secret girl.
But I'm gonna keep it girl
O you's a colledge girl.
Come be a Gucci girl.
O you's a Gucci fan.
Let's go to Gucciland.
And be your Gucci man.
Cause only Gucci can.
Drop a rag.
Pop your bag.
With a rubberband.
You diggin Gucci Gucci.
Let's do the oochi koochi.
O that's yo girlfriend.
Why don't you introduce me.

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"What They Do"
(feat. Khia, Young Snead)



[Intro: Gucci Mane (Khia)]
(Thug Misses in the house!)
Geah! Gucci Mane in the house
Gucci Mane, Laflare
(This is Big Cat reppin)
Big Cat in the building, so watch yo' mouth
So watch yo' mouth - tell me what they do?
(Tell me what they do?) Shawty what you doin?
Shawty what? Throw it up
(Oh you want me over there?)
Tell me what they do? (Tell me what they do?)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
What they do? What they do?
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolute
Then they turn to prostitutes

[Khia]
(Tell me what they do?)
Thug Misses and I'm lookin for a Thug Mister
Big spender, break bread like a real mister
Drop low to your knees boy, whistle on it
Then put that wood on me, cut me like you paid for it
It's on you, let me know if you really want it
You on Goose, so I know you gon' get loose
Pop a pill, do what you been wantin to do
Then make it rain like a motherfuckin hurricane
I hate lames, if you want it you gotta suck on it
Get it right, if you want it you gotta bid on it
Real thick and my sugar got gold on it
Spend on it, make a chick put her friend on it
Good neck, good back, ohh yeah I want it!!
Slide on it, make a chick wanna ride on it
Hair on it mean the nigga ain't scared of it
Thug Misses, Gucci Mane and you still want it

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Tell me what they do?
For about a hundred dollars she'll let you come through
Two hundred dollars take her clothes off too
Three hundred she'll be all on you
For the fo' give a blowjob 'til she turn blue
Five hundred dollars she'll eat a girl too
Drop the whole stack she'll do the whole crew
Hoes get loose when they drink Grey Goose
Seee the Coupe on rims with the big sunroof
You can bring your friend and your homegirl too
Damn what you heard, baby girl it ain't true
I don't like her girl I really like you
Cause she already told me what she wan' do
Love it when you fresh and you wear perfume
Everybody stare when I walk in the room
Chain frostbit like a New Year's Eve
But the watch on fire like the first day of June

[Khia]
Let me show you what a real boss chick do
Make you feel real special when I'm on you
Slide low lay back and enjoy the ride
Super wet stay gushin on the inside
Water flowin like a stream call me Aquafina
A real bad mamma jammer, love it when you beat it
Stay fresh, stay tight, pumpin all night
I got that comeback, strokin on it just right
Guys we can play hard if you want to
Act like you don't want it when you know you do
It's real simple, use your lips then use your chin
Tip that pole back, baby sip on all the milk
Fruity Pebbles lips tastin like Fruit Loops
Lovin what you do when you gone on the Goose
You love it what I'm doin when I'm gone on the Goose
You gettin crunk and loose, good to know you suck it too

[Chorus]

"Aw-Man"
(feat. .45)



[Intro]
Yeah Money Makin' Records man
T know Laflare Entertainment
True what's happening?
Yeah, I call'em true cause they know they the truth dawg
That boy Gucci
Yeah, we make them hoes say

[Chorus: .45]
Yo trap don't boom like mine
Yo paper ain't longer than mine, than mine
Aw man [8X]
Yo bitch ain't finna than mine, than mine
Yo rims ain't talla than mine, than mine
Aw man [8X]

[Verse 1]
You never seen a thug like this aw man
I'm choppin down them bricks tryin to wipe Jackie Chan
My money come fast, my work come in grams
My soldiers keep straps like they work for Uncle Sam
My chain like ugh, my wrist like damn!
I show up at the jewler with a hundred thousand cash
Drop top Porsche, inside DAMN
Outside red lookin like a Coke can
I keep a pretty brown round and young yellow
I gotta butta pecan Rican and a French vanilla
My trap boom hard, my bitch real fine
Poppi on the way, we call it crunch time

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'ma lean with it, serve a fiend with it
On the block since the age of thirteen with it
In the kitchen water whippin, a thousand eight grams
I'm standin over the stove and I'm doin it with one hand
Aw man, fruit man, Toucan sam, two hundred and seven gram
Got yam, a long Lamb', I'm sellin that grown man
Aw man, I'm on that Kush tonight
And I ain't stoppin chopper hit'chu and your body start rockin
My chain got pneumonia, watch got the bird flu
Came to the club smellin like a pound of purple
Big Cat ruckus, nigga it's a movement
This aint hip-hop, this is drug dealer music

[Chorus]

[.45]
I trap hard nigga, stunt hard nigga
E'ry bitch in the club jock a young nigga
Fo'-five, Big Cat representa nigga
Them twenty-eights sittin high, I'm a giant nigga
Blowin kush muh'fucker, can you smell me nigga?
Ridin through the city flyin with the top back
Quarter ki' of the yam in the knapsack
Big Tank throwin pills to the quarterbacks
Me and Mailman (geah!) at'cha bitch house
Baby momma cookin work at the trap house
She servin coke like she work at the Waffle House
Fo'-five count stacks at the stash house

[Chorus]

"Bad Guys"
(feat. Black Magic)



[Intro]
It's the bad guys
Say hello to the bad guys!
Big Cat Records, Gucci, Black Magic

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We the bad guys, and we play for the bad team
We hauntin ya life like you just had a bad dream
The bad guys...
Just don't get on our bad side

[Gucci Mane]
I fucks with the AR, I fucks with the AK
You fuckin with Gucci, you gon' have a bad day
They say I'm a mad guy, they call me the bad guy
I tell ya like this just don't get on my bad side
I come with that skreet shit, in love with this beef shit
My diamonds ocean blue so they might get ya seasick
I fuck with the Glock 40, {?} shotty
Plus when I aim then I aim for the upper body
Ain't with that hoe shit, I'm smokin that 'dro shit
You come with some mo' shit, you gon' get your throat slit
Yeah this is that G shit, we call it a classic
I have my nigga Magic put that ass in a casket
And that there is real talk, you best have a fast walk
Or else yo' bitch ass might get lined in the white chalk
Fuck what you thank nigga, fuck what you thought nigga
Wired for jaw, so yo' ass can't talk nigga

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Is you a man nigga? Is you a mouse nigga?
Have yo' bitch ass scared to come out the house nigga
Gucci fear no man, so who is this Snowman?
The word on the low is he really a hoe man
Bitch stick to that trap shit, and stick to that rap shit
You say you a gangster, but you never clapped shit
If you wanna find me, take I-20 Flat Shoals
Let's see if you can take this broomstick up your asshole
Always gon' stand ground, never gon' back down
I'm puttin my mack down, I'm layin the smack down
See Gucci's a skreet nigga, I stay on that skreet shit
And I'm the wrong nigga that ya clique wanna beef with
I keep the 9 close like the bitch that you sleep with
And I'll bust a head but can you keep a secret?
I'm smokin that kushie, you niggaz is pussy
I never been a killer but you pussies done pushed me

[Chorus]

[Black Magic]
Now this the bad guy song, they put the bad guys on it
So listen when you hear the two bad guys talkin
I shoot straight, move weight, always in a new state
Always givin fake names, cars got paper plates
The bad guy, say hello to my little friend (say hello)
My lil' friend got a hundred other lil' friends
Now we the bad team, it's more than a bad dream
Gucci and Black Magic now that's a bad scene
Carbon 15's comin out, AK's comin out
I'ma run the North, Gucci run the South
Independent but we ballin like majors
Them fruity ones got 'em all flavors
I'm fuckin with real niggaz and players, killers and cutthroats
And when I get a order homey somebody gettin smoked
I'm no joke, catch the kid cookin up coke
I got a blunt full of bubba kush, nigga come smoke with us

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Pillz (Remix)"
(feat. Big Tank, Mac Bre-Z)



[Intro]
(Zaytoven!!)
Geah! Gucci Mane, is in the buildin
So Icy Entertainment, Zaytoven on the track
When we come to the club
We got the choppers on deck, and the yoppers on deck

[Chorus]
[MB] Is you rollin? [4X]
[GM] Bitch I might be [4X]
[MB] Girl he geeked up [4X]
[GM] Bitch I might be [4X]
[GM] Yaaaaahhh!

[Verse 1]
Game choppin like my rims, I'm choppin it up
'Til my 'caine gold like a pimp, I'm fresh as a bud
Plus I'm blowin on the sticky green, so I'm dro'ed up
And I'm rollin on the bean, so the city SLOWED UP~!
My team showed up, so you know we need a party pack
Callin Momma Stash, say she wanna be a part of that
Tell her I'm for real, and I keep a knot folded back
The next thang you know she tossin pills like a quarterback
Guc', I'ma throw it back, stacks I just showed you that
Deuces on the 88, they say I brought the roller back
Fifty for a dollar, hell yeah I can roll with that
Take it to the hood and let, Yatta get ahold of that
Got to be the coldest cat, ice froze the thermostats
Shawty had a Cali tat and Gucci called the Alley Cat
Shot a couple triple stacks and po'd up the iced tea
Slide on my stunna shades; geeked up? I might be

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Said I'm higher than a kite and me geeked up on these pills
Suave Stacks got me actin out, I know that she can tell
that I'm rollin (yeah) like the wheels on a bus
I need a cold Tropicana cause my heart about to bust
Look I'm sweatin like a dog and she askin for some mo'
Gave her couple of blue dolphins and I tell her to go raw
Bright lights lookin psychadelic, I'm off in the zone
Feelin strong like Superman, bitch I bust your dome
Said I'm smokin all the purple and drinkin all the 'gnac up
And I ain't feelin none of that until the next mornin bruh
My stomach fucked up, a couple holes in my brain
But I party like a rockstar, these bitches askin mane!

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, Laflare nigga, get'cha mind right
Order Crist' by the 12 like a case of Bud Light
Sell kush by the bell so you know my shit tight
7:30 in the mornin on an all night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shawty
So (Tell Me Where to Go) like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gon' party
Got a party pack of pills that's at least 'bout 40
I'll pour 'em in yo' hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pills call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pills man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

[Chorus]

[Mac Bre-Z]
Ay whassup Gucci Mane!
Why you sweatin so hard?
Is you rollin or somethin?

[Gucci Mane]
Shit well baby I might be
But got damn what is you doin?
You jockin a playa, you chew-chewy over here right
Look I aint K-Rab baby knahmean I'm not a piece of bubblegum
What I'm doin is not your business
But matter of fact while you over here is you a waitress or somethin?
Cause the shit you got on make you look like you a waitress
So do what you do aight I'ma give you this hundred dollars
Go get you whatever you drankin
Bring me and my clique about ten of them orange juices
five Crunk juices and we'll be straight how 'bout that
And is you straight is you single or is you married?
Cause I might be, bitch I might be
Bitch I might be, bitch I might be
YAAAAAAAHH

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Spanish Plug"



When I see my plug this how I talk to em
And when I serve my folks this how I talk to em
When I'm with my dawgs this how I talk to em
It's gucci mane la flar I'm finna talk to em

My guala, my partna, mota manana? gracias denada brought me years of dollars
Que pasa amigo? coca mudo necho cohina mucho es grande on the repo
Ese el pablo my barrio your barrio I'm ese my friende you speak real good engles
600 wednesday 5000 tuesday el nombre es gucci no punta no pussy
Ronas and kushi kilos and elbows chito seritas they come from mexico
There he go, 20 tacos got me 50 burritos, s 550 mercedes on flat shoals, que pasa manana
My guala guala, my partna partna, love to treat a nigga to a stingin lobsta, now a nigga owe him a million dollars,
Got me making 10 g's an hour, moneys power, time is money, you don't know the nigga then serve the dummy,
Serve the junkies then ride ashantis

[Hook]

What's the bombaglats my trap-spot, dreadlocks and rastas, rude boys and rude girls,
Jamaican mobsters, I shot the sheriff, smoking bob marley, all of this ecstacy is killing me softly
Turgo and curry, mid grade so pretty, this spots my x spot, can't dodge the red dot, smoking the lala,
Can't get no higher, where is me iya? she sends me fire, where is me lighter, look at me ice-uh,
Step up your neckpiece, I like your wife-uh, I pack a rifle, I love me life-uh,
Put up your hands before, I put up my rifle.

[Hook]

What's up nigga wut it do, I'm good my nigga how are you, half a chicken, whole chicken, quarter chicken
What it move? Bentley coupe on bentley shoes, hell na them ain't 22's, still keep coke in inner tubes,
Plotting on my next buissness move, 26 inch tennis shoes, old school paint it maserati blue,
Brought my gun, but forgot my roof, pulling up with your baby boo, ooh ooh it's you know who,
It's nascar baby what you gonna do, looking for something thick I can screw, paint change
And my diamonds too, trap nigga watch reminding you, my grill and ring be blinding you,
If you a stubborn artist I'm signing you, I'm still the same nigga that be shining too,
Trap nigga, watch reminding you, my grill and ring be blinding you,
If you a stubborn artist I'm signing you, I'm still the black nigga that be shining too bitch.

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Product"



[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Eight, for them O's and a dollar for them balls
Eight throwin stove and some water in a pot
Wait until it's cold then watch it harden on the spot
Straight out the do' and put that product on the block, nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm fin' to bounce back, up out this 20 flat
We got cook up, we got powder, nigga you want that?
I got a fish scale, I burn that white back
Don't need a glass man, I bring that blast back
Niggaz cain't wait 'til I hit the hood and cook it
If you wanna learn fuck nigga start lookin
I knock 'em out solid, shot in a circle
Sell a quarter brick then I cop a ounce of purple
Then the O's for..

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
We got eight for the O's and a dollar for them balls
Soon as I finish my ball might hit the mall
Got stacks on deck and they ten feet tall
(Oh you moochin ass niggaz?) Man y'all money too small
Pyrex check, baking soda check
Then you put that fish scale in that water next
Twelve by twelves, nigga hit your front steps
Serve e'ry fuckin fiend 'til there's nothin left

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I charge eight for the O's, seventeen for a thirty-six
Nine for a half, fifty-five for a quarter brick
Traphouse, crackhouse, slab a jacker back out
Nigga want some beef then I have to bring the Mack out
Drug deals; eight dollars for the X pill
Put a big bullet hole where you chest is
Never broke but I hope that the boat with the dope
don't sink just float as I sell plenty coke

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"2 Screws Loose"



[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Them niggaz is gangsters, them niggaz is Shady
Them niggaz got screws loose, them niggaz is crazy
Walk around with they boots loose, tuckin 380's
Standin in the trap screamin fuck you pay me

[Verse]
Nigga I'm one-seven-five wet, movin like Deebo
Boxcutter like a nigga work at Home Depot
Rep for my people, a big Desert Eagle
Shootin at your bucket like a Marbury free throw
Bitches get nothin, zilch I mean zero
Tommy gun sprayed at them niggaz playin hero
Niggaz in the hood don't peep through no peephole
Cameras and motion scanners, try to creep hoe
Most of us iced out, some don't even rock jewels
They in the club for a purpose, and that's to bang the tool
Street smart, I'm far from that college dude
Love gettin good brains, bitches give me knowledge fool
It don't take much, a little weed and the dutch
Couple sips of that Remy, now she wanna fuck
Hoes see a nigga chain swingin wanna touch
Rocks used to be cubed up, now my shit is crushed

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
My pack came in, I want seventeen-five for 'em
Bricks go down when you get more than five on 'em
Packin down to eight, I was holdin that 'tel down
2006 and now we're breakin them bells down
Gucci you the shit, least that what they told me
Catch me in the 6 a nigga right where the show be
I fronted you a nine so five what you owe me
If you don't pay me then it's back to the old me
Cocallina same color the snow be
Haters get found in the Okefenokee
You trap that's cool, I trap to school
I'm trappin boo, but I'm rappin too
Not a role model, hit that purp'
I'm not a role model little shorty hittin up turf
I'm not a role model, hit that purp'
I'm not a role model young nigga cook that work

[Chorus - to fade]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"16 Fever"



[Bridge:]
I'm charging 16 fever, 16 fever, nigga my price cheaper, 16 fever

[Chorus: x2]
16 fever coke-I-ina, X pills bubble kush mid grade reefa
Hoes ridin vics dog but I ride beemurs
I swear da red chain'll cost 16 fever

[Verse 1:]
16 5-0, there go 5-0
I'm up 2-5 but I need 4 more
I got uncles blowin bundles, mine do numbers while I drive lambo
Off white yayo digital scale, fish scale sending my pigeons by mail
Bring in my drain folk, ? just bring me that cane folk
Gucci got good dope pillz purp and sizzurp, my workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd
Gucci got good dope pillz purp and sizzurp, my workers don't move for nothing less than a bizzurd

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
Bricks can't keep em 16 fever, bemmur speakers, geek-a-meters
Misdemeanors several subpeonas, see I'm gone drink up cause we just linked up
The squad been teamed up we cutting off fingers, it's 16 fever and that's since april
My corvette paid for my old school paid for, the hummer roll up that means you assed out
And you didn't cash out see this my traphouse I slam fiends backs out we push white sacks out
See this my traphouse I slam fiends backs out we push white sacks out, them backs get pushed out

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
I'm scraping the bowl up, I'm whipping up cake mix
But this ain't red velvet don't eat it, ya smoke it
Your options are open, you even can snort it
3 dollar sacks so you know you can score it, say you can't afford it
Yo I can ignore it, well don't call them dope boys you know you feel boring
You know that you feenin you know that you need it, it's gucci I'm greedy, my niggas stay eating

[Chorus x2]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"15 Minutes Past The Diamond"



[Intro]
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane geah
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane uhh
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane [2X]
So Icy E-N-T [3X]
It's the kid [2X]
It's the kid again [echoes]

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Shawty asked me what time it is?
I said it's fifteen minutes past the diamonds bitch
In Laflare, in the cockpit, Gucci the prophet
Bel Air shoppin, West coast hoppin

Gucci! Niggaz get popped still not get Cochran
Now ask Josh Avanta{?} or Egalin{?}
Lawyers, doctors, and policemen
Jewelers, Buellers, and co-pilots
My hood life {?} burn the verse like lightning
My flow so frightening, it not nothin nice man
See I shoot bul-lets and you shoot dice man
It's my life man, so I'ma stay {?}
See I'm no red man, and I'm no white man
I don't pay a car check, my Aston Martin
My chain be shinin, my grill be sparklin
It's Gucci darlin, now whassup shawty?

[Chorus]

Shawty so sexy but she be flexin
Oh he ride Lexus, ooh I fly frequent
Oh he pop bottles, then I'm not drinkin
Oh that smell stinkin, is what I'm just thinkin
This whole outside why didn't you make it?
Oh boy you left it, so bitch I bet ya
In and out the Range with a four dollar outfit
Talkin 'bout your man tell him why you a trick bitch
On to the next one, shawty the best one
From Houston, Texas, damn she vibrant
Crushin, blushin, I got her smilin
The sunburnt eyelids, but I'm not whylin
I'm admirin, she perspirin
The way she dancin, has got me risin
Let's go kick it, let's go shoppin
Tear the mall up girl I'm not poppin

[Chorus]

It's Gucci baby, it's (groovy baby)
The Maybach mango, the inside gravy
My wrist game crazy, connect beez hazy
My 180, the track Fugazi
The black still shady, I know they hate me
The white won't date me, but you won't let up
But you know better, cause you gon' save her
I know you paid her, did her favors
But that's not player, and that's not gangster
My fingers got a pimp {?} cause I'm no banker
See I'm her thinker, battleship sank her
So Icy Entertainment we cuttin off fangers

[Chorus]

"I Know Why"
(feat. Pimp C, Rich Boy, Blaze-1)



Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
24's on the Chevy, look like I'm 'bout to fly

Take flight on a hoe, ride a kite on a bitch
Lear jet coochie when I ride on six's
And I sit high like I ride on switches
Rent it out the ass, dudes barkin', hoes keep lookin'

Shackles wanna jet but they don't keep black
Candy coated Lac with the back pushed back
Shorty smoke thrax, what chu know 'bout that?
Let the top back, the hood catch, cut tax

It's a known fact, Gucci smoke on purp
Old school verdict with the ace on the skirts
It's a tough dash, paint look like glass
Like can't do skatin' and the don't start hatin'

28 D.U.B.s on roll tank, these haters want dates
I tell 'em get chu straight

Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
24's on the chevy, look like I'm bout to fly

Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
Bitches love me, dey niggas hate me, I know why
24's on the chevy, look like I'm bout to fly

That nigga, she just love me
Watch me ride by, wanna fuck me
She me in the club, wanna suck me
Guess that why yo man, he wanna buck me

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"I Might Be"



Is you rollin? [x4]
Bitch I might be [x2]

Girl he geeked up
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be [x4]

[Verse 1:]
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy til your bitch came in
Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinkin this Buffie The Body
Ain't your name lil Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin for that action
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin
Ridin in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin
On two eighty five I keep ridin in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin like a pound of purple
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes and a cold orange juice cause I'm really really trippin
Went to the strip club and request that I'm da man
The next thing you know I was throwin rubberbands

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Shawty tellin me she ain't neva suck no dick
Neva took a pill or neva ate a bitch
You a lie but I ain't gonna get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you marry well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't Icy like me
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee
When dem dope man nikes and dem jore ass jeans-Jordache Jeans
I don't pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
I'm a the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves that's three
Ain't no waffle house baby hell I can't eat
Gucci hood like your hoodman hes so extreme
Wearin doces in the club cause you kno the boy geeked
Top the top on that thang let you see my seats
We've been rollin rollin rollin we ain't slept in weeks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Gucci Mane the flyy nigga get your mind right
Or a crys by the twelve like a case of budlight
Sell a cush by a bell so you kno might shit tight
See I'm 30 in the morning on a all night flight
I'm high like Fabo hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gonna party
Got a party pack of pillz that's at least bout 40
I'll pour dem in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pillz call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pillz man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

[Chorus]

Ay wassup Gucci Mane. Why you sweatin so hard? Is you rollin or somethin.
Shit well baby I might be. But got damn what is you doin. You jockin a playa.
You ch-Chewy ova here right. Look I ain't
(K-Reilly) K-Rab baby You know what I mean I'm not a piece of Bubblegum.
What I'm doin is not your business. But matta of fact while you ova here is you a waitress or somethin?
Cause the shit you got on make you look like you a waitress.
So do what you do iight. I'm a give you this hundred dollars.
Go get you what ever you drankin.
Bring me and click about ten of dem orange juices, five crunk juices nd we'll be straight how bout that.
And is you straight is you single or is you marry.
Cause I might be, Bitch I might be, Bitch I might be, Bitch I might be

"What I'm Talking Bout"



Head bangers
YEAHHH!
YEAHHH! (UHHH UHHH UHHH UHHH)
YEAHHH! (UHHH)

Gucci mane laflair
It's money in the air
It's ballin over here
It's models over there
It's party over there
We ballin over here
It's gucci mane laflair
This song is out of here
That's what I'm talkin bout
I'm gettin guapped out
And I don't swap it out
Ya better walk it out
Cause if I pull it out
There's nothin to talk about
This what I'm talkin bout
Know what I'm talkin bout
They don't give a fuck
That's what the fuss about
Chickens in the kitchen
That's what I'm talkin bout
And I'll talk ya out
And I'll cross ya out
And I'll move ya out
That's what I'm talkin bout

[CHORUS: x2]
28 inch rims that's what we talkin bout
Million just on our jewels that's what we talkin bout
Birthday cake for the crew that's what we talkin bout
Ya either cash it in or we'll cash ya out

Girl we'll getcha drunk
And then we'll dog you out
Kick you to the curb
That's what the boss about
Know what I'm talkin bout
On some twenty eights
That's what I'm talkin bout
It's sittin so high
I don't see the traffic
But I can see the sky
I just get the cake
But I don't see the pie
Walk through the club
We don't see tha lines
They don't pat us down
So they don't see the nines
Where I party at
Ya know I'm keeping mine
Ya know I'm sneakin mine
Gotta keep in mind
Know what I'm talkin bout
That's what I'm talkin bout
Whatcha talkin bout
So icey bank shop

[CHORUS x2]

Signed with atlantic
Now I'm makin mills
Bitch I might
Gone off of pills
Paint match the wheels
The chain match the grill
Make a record deal
Hundred dollar bills
Know what I'm talkin bout
You don't know about
Pull up to the bank
And snatch a hundred out
Then smash out
To my shawtys house
Let's go shoppin shawty
That's what I'm talkin bout

YYEEAAAHHHH! (PUSSY!)

[CHORUS x2]

Jyea

Fresh up off the grind 
Me and my lil buddies 
And we finna Jump the line 
Jump the line every time 
You know we jump the line 
Fresh up off the grind 
And we finna jump the line 

We pull up to the club 
Fresh up off the grind 
Me and my lil buddies 
And we finna jump the line 
Jump the line every time 
You know we jump the line 
Fresh up off the grind 
And we finna jump the line 

Your mane is my name 
Gucci is what they call me 
Six months I lost it 
Now bitch I ball it 
Twenty-eight inches 
Got me standin' really tall man 
Tearin' up the mall 
This is just the way I ball man 
Cocaine ounces 
Blue and yellow wristband 
Chain look iceland 
Watch my breitling 
Niggas think ice can 
Gucci think island 
Niggas think charger 
Gucci think 'rrari 
-sorry, 
Murcialago I park it 
Inside peanut butter 
Outside change it 
Now outside 
Get it inside stranger 
Diamonds look mustard 
S 600 

We pull up to the club 
Fresh up off the grind 
Me and my lil buddies 
And we finna jump the line 
Jump the line every time 
You know we jump the line 
Fresh up off the grind 
And we finna jump the line 

We pull up to the club 
Fresh up off the grind 
Me and my lil buddies 
And we finna jump the line 
Jump the line every time 
You know we jump the line 
Fresh up off the grind 
And we finna jump the line 

I enter to the club 
Im lookin for a girl 
She lookin for a thug 
Like I'm lookin for a pull 
I bought a pack of bullets 
I showed her lot of jewels 
I gotta lot shows, see 
I really gotta know 
But I ain't gotta know 
I'm standing real low 
I'm backin out my auntie 
How she says she doesn't know 
She put at the house 
And I'm back in the drought 
And it made me feel real good 
When I came back with that phat 

We pull up to the club 
Fresh up off the grind 
Me and my lil buddies 
And we finna jump the line 
Jump the line every time 
You know we jump the line 
Fresh up off the grind 
And we finna jump the line 

We pull up to the club 
Fresh up off the grind 
Me and my lil buddies 
And we finna jump the line 
Jump the line every time 
You know we jump the line 
Fresh up off the grind 
And we finna jump the line 

Im south beach in miami 
Ready in my ferrari

On my 07' astin martin 
Baby got a jaguar

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Stash House"



Burn up our door, 
Hard wood floor, 
Money on the table, 
I'm in my stash house, 
Bricks going in, 
Birds going out, 
I stashed a 100 mill, 
Off in my stash house 

[x3]
Order room 2 
Order room 1 (Im in my Stash House) 
Especially for tonight, it's some Shawty Redd drums. 

Burn up our door, 
Hardwood floor, 
Money on the table, 
I'm in my stash house, 
Come on in cash out, 
Birds in a drought, 
Hole lot of soft, 
In my stash house 

If it don't jump the first time, cook it again, 
Den call the dope man shawty get you a ten,

In a bubbled eyed Benz cuz I'm gettin it in,

If a nigga touch a hair on my chiny chin chin, 
On my chin chiller trench, then we spending a ben,

"I Move Chickens"



I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens

In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens
In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent

Shawty rap about gucci stay strapped with a uzi
Murder 1 platinum eatin justice by tuesday
It's gucci mane excuse me dawg I'm makin my music
For facin me a nigga fight about what a toothpick?
I did 6 months incident with a pool stick
They found a nigga guilty still say ain't do shit
Major league minor league was indipendent
I moved on shawty gucci handled his business
And I ain't goin back to jail god is my witness
I'm grinnin so hard it look like it's a picnic
So icey entertainment in atlantic
I'm trapped in spanish for slayin them dragons
Nigga

I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens
In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens
In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent

I'm chef boy ardee and I'm cookin a QB
I'm whippin up the gravy the feins say that it's tasty
I'm up 980 soulja strapped like the navy
It's fuck you pay me bitch what you done lately
I growed up crazy boy 1980
A true trapy babybitch this ok maybe
The streets raised me I drove my kinfolks crazy
Rather buy purp then pleasure
Gucci won't mean lazy Nigga

I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens
In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens
In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent Shawty

From start to the finish gucci mane the apprentice
So every word letter I had lived every sentence
This perfectly place created an indention
I'm trappin and cursin for rappin the chinese
Down south finest it's gucci your hinus
Crazy color diamonds they got me shinin (TRUE!)
Bitch arms up climbin up a cut like tyson
I'm big cruz diamond but got no license
Lanes talk senseless G's you silence
And you can these dog but I use violence
I'm trappin like a house over trap house cloudy
Your stones cloudy so your not balling

My down south swag got the fine hoes callin
My swag so norm and my grill so gnawless
My down south swag got the fine hoes callin
My swag so norm and my grill so gnawless

I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens
In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens shawty
I'm moving chickens
I move chickens
In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent Shawty

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Ballers"
(feat. Shawnna)



[Verse 1: Shawnna]
Shawnna got a 'lac sittin' on tres
Shawnna don't need no nigga I'm paid
Shawnna got stacks
Shawnna got grip
Shawnna got that so you better not slip
I'm posted on tha block
My girls tippin' dro
This cafe patron got me sippin real slow
I'm lookin like a star
Ice on my neck
Ice on my wrist
Ice on my chest
You might wanna fit but I ain't on that
I'm way fucked up
I'm way tore back
And I don't give a fuck I got it like that
They took a niggas juice
I got it right back
And now they like 'damn'
Now they like 'amazing'
Tondra roll 4, 5 blunts and we blazin'
Look at shawty gazin'
He lookin like he want me
I'm sorry little daddy
I'm tryna get ya homie

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Lames can't call her (Lames can't call her)
All she date is ballers (She only date ballers)
Shawty got a fetish (For boys who go get it)
Squares can't call her (Squares can't call her)

Lames can't call her (Lames can't call her)
All she date is ballers (She only date ballers)
Shawty got a fetish (For boys who go get it)
She only date ballers (It's miss Shawnna)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm Gucci Mane Laflare, I'm MVP
I know your baby mama real proud of me
The Benz line say they get tired of me
I'm young kush man I sell nothin but QP's
Shawnna so fine, Gucci mane I'm good
She so pretty, but still so hood
Hey little darling, How you shawty?
I'm so marvelous, I can't call it
I'm so southern, you so northern
We so crack rock, they so corny
It's two-thirty early, I'm horny
The way I cook a brick It's like I'm doin a performance
All eyes on we, Homegirl want me
Say he on tha track, So tha track real funky
Pants red monkey, Gucci go donkey
Niggaz play crazy, get left stanky

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Lames can't call her (Lames can't call her)
All she date is ballers (She only date ballers)
Shawty got a fetish (For boys who go get it)
Squares can't call her (Squares can't call her)

Lames can't call her (Lames can't call her)
All she date is ballers (She only date ballers)
Shawty got a fetish (For boys who go get it)
She only date ballers (It's miss Shawnna)

[Verse 3: Shawnna]
Ay
Shawnna
I wrote the first 3
For bitches in tha hood
My and 1 bitches
Smokin on tha good
Sittin on tha porch
Sippin on tha 'gnac
Or posted in tha parking lot
Sittin on tha 'lac
Them bitches got weight
Them bitches got work
Them bitches wanna trip
Them bitches gettin murked
And stick em in tha dirt
And gone bout our business
And it ain't nothin personal
It's all bout tha figures
It's M.O.E
Till a bitch a dead
And I don't give a fuck bout what a bitch said
I'm still gettin money
I'm still gettin rich
I'm still that woman that will take your dick
Yeah tha truth hurts
You still gotta face it
I spent ya whole deal on my ring and my braclet
It's top notch twat
Cream of tha crop
I'm beatin down ya block
And let the choppers Chop Chop Chop Chop Chop Chop

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Lames can't call her (Lames can't call her)
All she date is ballers (She only date ballers)

"My Kitchen"



Bouldercrest CEO speaking
So Icey Entertainment CEO speaking
(Iceeeey) Blood In Blood Out member speaking
East Atlanta, Bouldercrest affiliated (chea, chea)
It's ya boy Gucci
Another beat banger, Fatboi fucking with me

Put the pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen

Thirty thousand dollars for the So Icey Squad
Thousand pound deal for the So Icey Boys
Gucci Aquarius a So Icy shark
Selling white chalk tryna duck these narcs
Bought some Lowenharts and some D.U.B.'s
34 inch Ashanti's on the Humvee
Whole lot of purp, whole lot of green
Whole heap of white, large amount of beans
Got them collard greens, sell a lot of things
Four plus a four, dawg, that's a chicken wing
Trapping in a drought, money in the vault
Bring me another pot and another fo'
Gucci!

Put the pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen

Gucci don't care, scale like yeah
Mojo's there, egg beaters there
RIP to Blockbeater, O.J. here (Juice)
Oh my God, it's Zone 6 year
Zone 6 chimps, Bouldercrest bear
Zone 6 rims, and Bouldercrest jills
30 inches got me looking down on him
And I'm so high, it's so lonely up here
Jumping out the vert, it's some bitches over there
Big booty bitches loves a good cooking player
Bricks in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Pounds in the closet, money in the attic
GUCCI!

Put the pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen

Dope bowl crack, now we getting mad
But we ain't really lost cause we can Isotol dat ass
When we bringing route, bring it to your door
Money on the floor, bring money to the door

Put the pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Hella Ones"



Hella ones, hella ones
Make it rain, thunderstorm
Make it rain, swing your chain
Zaytoven and Gucci Mane

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain
Let's have some fun, got hella ones
I'm having fun, got hella ones

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain
Let's have some fun, got hella ones
I'm having fun, got hella ones

Oh my gosh, I'm the sun
And the moon, cartoon
Yellow blue, who are you?
And what are those? that's not a rose
You changing clothes, I'm changing hoes
Switch up the flow, then write some more
Then drink some more, drink some more
Then smoke, then smoke
You ain't throwin ones shawty
You broke, you broke
Me and Zay, A to the Bay
Fuck what you heard, we smoking purp
We got work, got work
Cheap price, cheap price
Crazy color chains and don't they look nice? look nice?

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain
Let's have some fun, got hella ones
I'm having fun, got hella ones

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain
Let's have some fun, got hella ones
I'm having fun, got hella ones

She got that ass I got that stash
I'm throwing cash, gonna get it back
And do it fast, and come back, come back
Cause I never seen a body like that, like that
You remind me of some brand new 95 Air Max
A pound of purp in tracks
Baby girl you doing that
And you killing it, I'm feeling it
Pretty chick, you super thick
Don't know what to do with it
Matter fact I'm threw with it
This my song, I (ruin?) it
People like how she doing it?
Got a major deal and they pay me all the millions bitch
This my song, I (ruin?) it
People like how she doing it?
Got a major deal, now they just can say I'm nigga rich

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain
Let's have some fun, got hella ones
I'm having fun, got hella ones

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain
Let's have some fun, got hella ones
I'm having fun, got hella ones

On the Mars, hella fun
Pop a pill, roll a blunt
Get it down, so you can dance
I'm Gucci Mane, I'll be your man
I got a girl, you got a man
I got a room, I got a plan
I got a vette (got a vette) and a hummer
I make it [?] in a summer

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain
Let's have some fun, got hella ones
I'm having fun, got hella ones

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain
Let's have some fun, got hella ones
I'm having fun, got hella ones

Though my leather is so soft I put my top off in the trunk
Baby shakin' gettin' places say she seen me in my dump
Picked her up in purple 'vette deuces on back 20s on front

And that Lambi and a Bentley shout out to my nigga Quic
Shout out to my boy Diego makin' pesos for them bricks

Well think you think you mad now I'm a make you madder

You mustard boy so ketch it up cause I think I'm so swaged up
Back on that dope shit tractor, trailer, boat shit
Cookin' up that coke quick, cookin' up that dope quick

Rollin up the chocha, I need me some mo' bruh
Partna you a puta, grande mude mucha
Ask me for a deuce, Fronted you an ocho
Bring me all my pesos, You know my amigo
My plug half Columbian, Gucci Mane's a negro
Smokin' on this weed doe

Ask me to speak English but I'm talkin' with my fingers
Brazilian bitches bathing in a bath tub full of singles
Snortin' powder, smokin' weed, yes they poppin' pills
M6 drop top Beamer shipped from Germany
Outfit from Sicily my bank account in Switzerland

Gucci Mane's the businessman so tell me what the business be BITCH

Shout out to my boy Rocco I ball like no tomorrow
And my watch is real retarded so I call it Lil Darryl

And I am legend jus like fresh prince
But dis no will smith I'm braveheart mel gibson
I'm samuel jackson cause I think it's time to kill em
The right wrist diddy but my left wrist fifty
I'm livin like pac but I'm spittin like biggie
A shoutout to aaliyah cause
Her voice was so pretty (R.I.P.)
I say what I feel like pimp c did it (R.I.P.)
Gucci tarentino or jus call me young quentin
Or Gucci nicholas cage I take ya girl in sixty seconds
Or Gucci Mane travolta davin's doin' the slow dancin
Call me so icey ventura got ya laughing
Keep dough like homer she suck it like maggie
I got donk beat in my trunk so the police start trippin
Sir I'm not drag racin I jus have a large engine (vrrrrrmmmm)

I don't think you feel me like I'm feelin myself
You suckas hatin on Gucci Mane dats bad for ya health

So ya hatin on the kid is like ya hatin on ya self

Get a good ticket cause dat dude there spend it
Million dollars hid right in 15 minutes
Cash the def check cop 2 hard top bentlys
Quarter million gone jus 15 seconds (well damn)

Got all of the accessories so Gucci Mane flexin
Backstage ticket cause da kid here kick it

It's a blowout no problem, bricks I still slam dunk em

Got a silver sniper rifle so I really shoot a jumper
Cross the game up dawg take it to the bucket
Say he like a tre so I pass it to da corner
I'm so hot I want it and I think
I'm on it jus like kobe keep the white girl but not a woman
See my hummer hold a 100 bills, stash the 40

Doin shows cross da country
So they grade me on performances

"I'm A Star"



[DJ Drama:]
See my shit?
My shit like Hollywood, right?
You call this the Gangsta Grillz walk of fame
Everybody waits to get they star
Gucci has officially been inducted!
Oh, they tried to keep 'em out
But don't worry, baby!
It's mainstream America from here on out!
C'mon man
Drum Cruise, nigga, this what I do!

[Gucci Mane:]
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains
And my tone game crazy, I am going black tonight, black tonight

SouthSiiiide!
So Iceeey!
On Moreland Road, four Moreland hoes
I think we smoked 5 o's or mo'
After we smoked 5 o's or mo'
Them hoes left, them some Moreland hoes
Them hoes was cheap as hell
I bought 'em Goose, them hoes wanted Glen Mo'
Them hoes wanted Glen Mo' to drank
Them hoes was broke, them hoes was broke
I know them hoes from school fasho'
Them hoes' mama be smoking dope
Dem hoes mama used to sell all
They clothes to me for the low low
Starter hat and Starter coat
Starter hat and Starter coat!
Falcon shirt, the Falcon hat
The furcoat man, you know I go
Go to school so fresh, you know
With yo shit, you know I go
Go to the lunchline with a bankroll
With a big ol' bankroll
You on the bus, Chevy 4-do'
You on the bus, Chevy 4-do'
You on the bus, I'm Chevy 4-do'
Beatin down da block, Candler Road

I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains
And my tone game crazy, I am going black tonight, black tonight

A Buick Regal, 8's and Bose
On Bouldercrest, I'm selling dope
At Texaco, where Mr. Kim keep saying
"Get away from sto'!"
No I can't get 'way from sto'
I got so much blow, gotta go
Gotta go, go buy some mo'
Holla at woe, go buy some low!
On Gresham Road with Randy Low
I think we blowed a half of dro
We think we gotta buy some mo'
We so high like a brick of coke
2004 had 40 wholes
40 halves and 40 wholes
You don't know 'bout Gucci Mane
He is from 'round Gresham Road
Sun Valley soldier, flex on soldier
Standing at tha Amaco
'96, I'm in the Hamps'
Finna get a dub to blow
Antwerp with me, Duct Tape with me
Zone 6 Kirkwood fucking with me
Gucci Mane La Flare
Eastside Atlanta, that's my city, huh

I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains
And my tone game crazy, I am going black tonight, black tonight

[DJ Drama:]
You see, I used to be Samuel L. Jakson
Means I had too many snakes on my plane
But now, I'm Jack Nicholson
'Cause I'm shining on you niggas

"You Know What It Is"
(feat. Yung Joc)



I'm infatuated intrigued
In need of weed, my need for speed got me buying Lamborghini's
My taste in fashion got my body covered in G's
My taste in trappin' got me sellin' kilos and P's

I'm infatuated intrigued
In need of weed, my need for speed got me buying Lamborghini's
My taste in fashion got my body covered in G's
My taste in trappin' got me sellin' kilos and P's

I'm infatuated intrigued
In need of weed, my need for speed got me buying Lamborghini's
My taste in fashion got my body covered in G's
My taste in trappin' got me sellin' kilos and P's

I'm in Miami with a wife beater feeling the breeze
A wife beater but I'm unmarried lookin' for skeeze
You say you classy and sadity, I say bitch you a tease
And ain't no teasing Gucci Mane I need a girl that's freaky
I drink my ros out the bottle ain't no glasses for me
I give my girl a glass of champagne she say thank you Gucci
I take her to the Gucci shop and she say thank you daddy
I tell her baby girl you welcome but it's really nothin'

I think she want me and I'm feeling the same way
But shawty bring your A game
When you see a player rollin', money can't be folded
I'm pretty sure you know what it is girl
And You know, you know, you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
And You know, you know, you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
(That's my world, That's my girl and you know and you know)
You know what it is Girl

You know I know I'm your uno
You think I'm the shit girl
40 thousand dollar pilot, First class flight to Pittsburg
The way I direct shit man they think that I'm Steven Spielberg
200 thousand dollar car so you know what it is girl
Put a bowtie on a Bentley flying Spur and chauffeur
The best time of her life she ever had I had to show her
She Wanna got down low down the floor
But I am no golfer
Fuckin' all these nurses
But no I am not a doctor

I think she want me and I'm feeling the same way
But shawty bring your A game
When you see a player rollin', money can't be folded
I'm pretty sure you know what it is girl
And You know, you know, you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
And You know, you know, you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
(That's my world, That's my girl and you know and you know)
You know what it is Girl

Candy coated birth 2 inches off the ground
Let your girl sing a song lemme lick you up and down
The first time I seen it I was leaning
Off the lean diamonds gleaming start to thinking (lil mama you got me fiending)
Her pinky ring is looking like a bedrock
Said she wanna take some pictures
First let's take some head shots
And now she got her legs cocked
I'm beating up the juice box (mo mo money make me cum)
Well Joc gon' make you cum non-stop
I wanna fuck her with the lights on all night long, to one of my songs
Let her keep my ice on, knock it up like tyson
Hit her with this python, clap on clap off get ya on my iPhone

I think she want me and I'm feeling the same way
But shawty bring your A game
When you see a player rollin', money can't be folded
I'm pretty sure you know what it is girl
And You know, you know, you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
And You know, you know, you know what It is Is Girl

(That's my world, That's my girl and you know and you know)

"Love For Money"
(feat. Trey Songz, Willie The Kid, Gucci Mane, LA The Darkman, Yung Joc, Bun B & Flo Rida)



I got the love for money
I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking
(Love for money)
I, I, I, I gotta have it
I, I, I, I got the love for money
I, I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking
(Love for money)
I, I, I, I gotta have it
I, I, I, I got the love for money

Chillin' with two women, me and mister thanksgiving
I'll be some where fly, Thanksgiving goin' swimming
While you was wearing snorkels, I was out snorkeling
Of course I'm shit on these niggas like porcelain
It's more than love with this money I'm infatuated
Captivated by the diamonds and capsulated
Shooting range in the basement, Olympic size pool
With pool table adjacent, I love me some money
I stash money fast money
Comin' on bumpin' them onions
Bunking and crossing the country
So, so don't cross me you monkey
Sleeping on 50s and 20
Rollin' up onions and hundreds, pulling in porches
And phantoms, fancies be throwing their panties
Drama and cannon demand it
Gucci and Drama they panic
Ugh, they sick they vomit
Put some more commas in front of it
Drama got Gucci he stuntin'
Gucci and Drama we done it
We got so much money, 'bout our money
Some money mo' money, dummy

I got the love for money
I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking
(Love for money)
I, I, I, I gotta have it
I, I, I, I got the love for money
I, I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking
(Love for money)
I, I, I, I gotta have it
I, I, I, I got the love for money

Uh, money gotta big house, money got a bad girl
Money make you famous, money rule the whole world
Money set trends, money is in the Benz
Money got associates acting like friends
Money, money he owe money money he blow
Money got sexy ladies dancing on da pole
Money got dem on a stroll, money platinum and gold
Money make 'em shake it like Beyonce Knowles
Only God knows the things I do for money
That's a young fly man
Check out them dimensions, 20s, 50s and 100s
Don't you make me look good when you see us out stuntin'?
Catch a whif, find out that's yo' bitch
Catch her pushin' your wheel, then the go and pushing clips
She got me going crazy I'm coo coo for boucoup bucks
Plus I can't lie, boo, it's only you I love

I got the love for money
I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking
(Love for money)
I, I, I, I gotta have it
I, I, I, I got the love for money
I, I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking
(Love for money)
I, I, I, I gotta have it
I, I, I, I got the love for money

I'm 'bout my instrument, I'm 'bout my doe
I'm on my hustle (man)
You already know
I'm getting stacks, I'm hitting lick
I'm packing pounds and bagging bricks
You got them [?] I gotta laugh
You talking Oz but selling halves
Where your connect? How much you got?
That's all he holdin'? Man, I buy him out

I got the love for money
I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking
(Love for money)
I, I, I, I gotta have it
I, I, I, I got the love for money
I, I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking
(Love for money)

I, I, I, I got the love for money

"Photo Shoot"



Listen to this track, bitch

Like Tommy Lee and Pamela I'm fucking on the camera
More stamina than Animals Gucci is no amateur
Jeru the Damaja could damage you or handle you
2 girls on my bike, one on the back one on the handle bars
Ferrari F-430, so I call that bitch Tarantula
Got Canada on Calendar so shout out to my manager
I walk through in South Africa
I jumped in my foreign Acura
I flip it just like spatula
So suck me just like Dracula
Polo like a college boy
No I'm not a college boy
I am a So Icey boy I'm tatted like a biker boy
We are the So Icey gang tatted like a biker gang
Dreaded up redded up
Wetted up and bet it up bitch you don't want bet
Pull up in my Chevy Vett
Nah you ain't ready yet
Wetter than your girl get
Dolce 'Bana, Dolce shades, Don't you wanna see the boy?
See the boy, see the boy
Come and take a Polaroid, Polaroid
Camera flash, camera flash I see your ass
Looking with your looking ass
So come and take a camera flash
Jewelry game amazing
Car game crazy
Gucci Mane LaFlare walking 'round the city, say cheese

Listen to this track, bitch

Hip-hop police say they looking after me
How You looking after me? You know I had a murder beat
Yea I had a murder beef, I'm just trynna get something to eat

How they gone catch me? I'm riding in a Lamborghin'

Bricks stashed in the basement, case a drought I bring em out boy
And I wipe u out boy without leavin my house boy
Remember that before u open up yo mouth boy
Yo woman give me nice jaw

Or flakin like it's dandruff
Control like damage

Put a bandage on my cuts vvs man

And um stackin bills like oldsmo

Popped da rugger top drove half dis nigga head off his brain sittin em like it's in a drop

DJ Drama & Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Show Me"



Bend your back, flip your shoulders, drop your head
Bust it open if you love it like you say you love it, baby girl
Show me some, girl (show me some, girl)
Got that back bent, shoulders drug and got it bust open
Saying "if you won't it come and get it, Gucci Mane, show me!"
Show me some, girl (show me some, girl)

You know I'll do it, sure I'll do it
Show me some, girl. Call me Gucci Mane La Flare
My name went down around the world
Buy you diamonds, buy you a purse
Potential to be my "Gucci Girl"
Take you to the Gucci store
They call that shit the "Gucci World"
Word: in the Louis shop you'll be my Louis girl
Buy you Louis, buy you Prada cause you look just like a model
We'll be poppin' bottles? Naw! We'll be poppin' cases
Gucci Mane La Flare got lawyers to fight all the cases
$100, 000 car, 50-carat bracelets
Half a million for the chain, Gucci Mane crazy!
Pull up in an '08, looking like a stingray
Then calamarr' in my brand new Ferarr'
Sorry, stepping on your fins with my Maurras
Got a nasty model cause it ain't about the dorras
Staring, staring, it's apparent that they staring
Baby girl, cause I'm fresher when I'm glaring

Bend your back, flip your shoulders, drop your head
Bust it open if you love it like you say you love it, baby girl
Show me some, girl (show me some, girl)
Got that back bent, shoulders drug and got it bust open
Saying "if you won't it come and get it, Gucci Mane, show me!"
Show me some, girl (show me some, girl)

Shorty want to marry me
Say she don't have sex casually
Don't want to be a casuality
Got a faculty, got more Magnums than an infantry
Baby, that's the penalty and trapping is just energy

Gucci Mane La Flare, you can call me "Guccirace"
Million-dollar shine: call me "Gucci Dibiase"
Like Ted Dibiase, put you in a "figure-4"
Gucci Mane La Flare: my car is on some 24s

Got them 4's on the Maserati
O, kimosabe
Got them bitches in the lobby
And they waiting on Guccirace
I got 4's on the Maserati
O, kimosabe
Got them bitches in the lobby
And they waiting on Guccirace

"I Live In A TV"



1 for the money, 2 for my jewelry game
3 for my luggage game (Dram' cruise!) Crazy luggage game Gucci
4 for shoes, 5 for my closet same size as your apartment
(Mr. Thanksgiving!) Well damn Gucci!
(Pay attention!)

So Icey the pharmacist, coca leaves like Sosa
I shoot you just like Tony
When homey knocked his sister down
Scarface Gucci: my life's a motion picture
Gucci Tarantino, Casino, Gucci Pacino
I'm Gucci Mane Soprano, more keys than a grand pianoWatching Blow, thinking George'll look out for Diego
I'm smoking on that color purple, working like I'm Harpo
Feeling just like Smokey felt when Craig beat shit out Debo
Call me Gucci Watch Me, freeze me, save me, watch me: TiVo
Your album came out, I rated it "worst". Response: I hated it
Boyz In The Hood, got juice and rock jewelry
Cars "Fast And Furious", shout out to my boy Ludacris
Supafly, High School Higher Than an Eagle eye
I think that they should legalize, my flow stronger than turpentine
Trafficking like Bailey, bricks coming across the border line
Bust a brick, he tell her: "Sniff", then she say that: "It's party time"
It's frightening and scary so they say I've got a horror mind
Gucci Mane not Stephen King but my car crazy like Christine
Rolls - Mary's baby born young and broke in 1980
Black and broke I'm thugging crazy, made it hard for mom to raise me
Set it off, Dead Presidents, hop out the trash can painted faces
Eddie Murphy: Trading Places
Sanford Son, Gucci Mane
But you can call me Shady Grady
Haha Gangsta Grillz you bastard, Gucci Mane will be your Daddy

I live in a TV, I live in a TV
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, I live my life in a TV
Tell me, do you hear me lady?
I know that you see me, Baby
I live in a TV, I live in a TV

Picture me posing in your plasma
Don't you think I'm handsome? There's no need to answer
My watch is so handsome; better yet attractive
Hoes think it's cute but my money got my pants sagging
I'm international and I'm icy like your baby daddy
No, I'm 10 times icier than your daddy
Tell your boy the truth: that his daddy is a faggot
Only reason that you had him was for your fucking taxes

"Top Of The World"



I got my motor running, amp pumpin, trunk jumpin, feet poppin
Smoking something, feeling good, feeling like I'm on top of the world
(Sitting on top on of the world)
(Sitting on top on of the world)
She got her Gucci sandals, Gucci shades, Gucci bag, Gucci chain
Say she like that Gucci Mane, so I'm laying on top of your girl
(Laying on top of your girl)
(Laying on top of your girl)

A black and gray spider it's no tarantula, ferrari F150 bruh
We make bitches scared of us, scared of us, scared of us
Ain't no competitor, predators, predators, all of us are predators
The sixth foot high is sexual, Gucci Mane I'm blessed bruh
I won't give a damn that girl cannot fit in my schedule, etcetera, etcetera
Yea I got etcetera, whole lot of lettuce bruh, whole lot of cabbage bruh
Yams, I got yams, give a damn, I got grams choppin, runnin up them bands since I was a young man
Call me Gucci Mane La Flare, call me Gucci VVS
See all this diamonds on my fingers, call me Gucci Liberace

I got my motor running, amp pumpin, trunk jumpin, feet poppin
Smoking something, feeling good, feeling like I'm on top of the world
(Sitting on top on of the world)
(Sitting on top on of the world)
She got her Gucci sandals, Gucci shades, Gucci bag, Gucci chain
Say she like that Gucci Mane, so I'm laying on top of your girl
(Laying on top of your girl)
(Laying on top of your girl)

Higher than a motherfuckin airplane, I just bought an airplane came back for one thing
A jet mane, now I got jet lag, a jet mane, now I got jet lag
Gucci carry on bag, gucci carry on, gucci carry long and I'm putting on skrong
Gucci bucket, Gucci wallet, Gucci head, and Gucci
Belt
Gucci mane La Flare I can design this shit myself
Red boy, lead boy, and I'm dripping red, cocking pistols back every time I'm hopping out my bed (boy)
Red boy, lead boy, and I'm dripping red, cocking pistols back every time I'm hopping out my bed

I got my motor running, amp pumpin, trunk jumpin, feet poppin
Smoking something, feeling good, feeling like I'm on top of the world

She got her Gucci sandals, Gucci shades, Gucci bag, Gucci chain
Say she like that Gucci Mane, so I'm laying on top of your girl

"Hurry"



I know y'all been waiting on the album
Lotta mixtapes
Ya know, lotta thangs
BURR!

Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci
Gucci got a warrant how the fuck I get subpoenaed?
Objection! What's the objection?
Your honor I'm a genius
13 years old got my Jordans in the cleaners
Like Lil Scrappy rockin FILAs
In the club Sho Nuff like Tela (Gucci!)
Black and white chain in the libra like a zebra
This is not your everyday ordinary fucking Beemer
This is no part of the seven it's a moss it cost a mean one
Got my top back for my grandma got my beater for Aaliyah
It's me and my money and my diamonds we a trio
And no disrespect to Ne-Yo but it's Gucci Mane I'm Sosa
And my albino Testarossa bout the color of the ocean
It's Gucci Mane La Flare and my bank account is rollin
Is you rollin?

Pounds came Thursday
Two days early
Plug showin love so my niggas count lovely
12 don't discouage me robbers don't worry me
My plug showing love so it's gone in a hurry
Yeah it's gone in a hurry
Push the white powder same color as my jewelry (well damn)
Yeah it's gone in a hurry
Plug showin love man 12's don't discourage me

911 emergency, Gucci making currency
Somebody call an ambulance I think my flow's been burglary
District has been murderin
Who you calling murderer
The only thing I'm killing is yo motherfuckin girl's jaw
Smoking on that fruity dro
Girl you look like Keyshia Cole
I know you a dick pulla
But can't fuck you Blood Raw
Damn I like them kinky flows
28 I'm young bitch
All white diamonds VVS white diamond bricks
Get back boy ole national
Two unrational hood hoez
Two deuces with two koolist
It's gucci gucci gucci stupid
285 I hu-la hoop it
'08 coupe without the roof
Told the dealer he can keep it
He can keep it I don't need it

Pounds came Thursday
Two days early
Plug showin love so my niggas count lovely
12 don't discouage me robbers don't worry me
My plug showing love so it's gone in a hurry

"Going In"



Standing in V.I.P. a hundred fifty deep
Jelwery all over me I look like Mr. T
My necklace is full of diamonds hell yea I'm shinnig bright
And bitches starrin at me starring so inpolite
What a sight to see tattoo all over me
A walkin work of art I took a lot of ink
Kids want my autograph hoes want my phone number
But I'm so damn conceited gave her the wrong number
No need to speak I rather keep it brief
I took a couple keys [?]
Maybe to you but damn sure not to me
Five hundred fifty a piece now that's a lot of trees

I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in
Once again, once again, once again, once again
I play to win, I play to win

I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in
Once again, once again, once again, once again
I play to win, I play to win

I ride exotic cars, I smoke expensive weed
Yeah, that's the life of Gs and you are not a G
And you can't walk with me because you are not with me
He wants to get in free but he is not with the team
This is not a dream and this is not a game
Step on my denim jeans, is up by 50 grands
Of in the club wgrams
That's a half a pound we blew it like a fan
Nigga I'm the man, women taking pictures
They want to touch my hands they want to hit my swishers
I'm fuckin with you, if you fuckin with me
Cause we just bought the bar, so is ya drinkin with me?

I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in
Once again, once again, once again, once again
I play to win, I play to win

I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in
Once again, once again, once again, once again
I play to win, I play to win

I'm in magic city, the center of attention
I'm standing in the light I'm lookin like a tiki
A whole a milli I mean a cool million
Since they know I'm ballin they want to have my children
Want to feel it, do you really feel it?
This isn't just rap is really how I kick it
I'm chillin like a villian cause really I'm a villian
So listen to my struggle I make you see my vision
Like a blind man you can't see the kid
I'm like a deaf man cause you can't tell me shit
Bitches fight daily you ain't fight cases
Got money so out wasted I'm thirty rolling glacier

I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in
Once again, once again, once again, once again
I play to win, I play to win

I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in
Once again, once again, once again, once again
I play to win, I play to win

DJ Holiday & Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Game"
(feat. Kourtney Money & OJ The Juiceman)



Yup! Yup!
Gucci Mane in this motherfucker (Gucci Gucci)
My nigga Zo' on the track (my nigga Zo')
That real shit, that real shit

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

I ain't never had shit nigga that's the truth
Rich kids in the school used to jones my shoes
Name stayed on the board, fo' checks in chalk
In detention cause the teacher say that we can't talk
Counselor raggin and my momma got that I just walk
I wish I had a nickel for every fight I fought
Stealin candy out the sto' like I can't get caught
Just a lil' bad black boy, it ain't my fault
After school snack syrup and fo' pieces of bread
Granddaddy why yo' eyes so God damn red?
"Got a real soft ass and a hard-ass head
Better mind your fuckin manners boy," that's what he said

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

I moved to East Atlanta at the age of 9
Real cold winter, 1989
My brother good at ball, I can't play no sports
They won't let you pack a tool on the b-ball court
Cluster Ave, Monty Paul, where my daddy now?
Things goin alright, we a family now
Got the dopeman Nikes and the Starter coat
Only nigga in school with the dopeman rope
Pull the joint two times, man I'm high already
I like that girl with them braids and them high-top Chevys
Got that bump for stick-up, Starter and the big boy chest
Tried to take it on the train but I just couldn't let him

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

14 gettin drunk at a house party
They locked me up, they must have hid a half a ounce on me
Momma mad as a mother', daddy let him be
Gucci Mane, raised me to be a straight up G
Now my daddy hustle hard, but he love sum liquor
And my momma wanna leave him but she love the nigga
Everything kinda changed when I turned 16
Got the old school Regal with the chrome back rings
Like a newborn baby, man that bitch clean
But the motor fucked up and the transmission
And it's knockin down the street with the 415's
In Mackmile parkin lot, stright whipping
And I'm Bankhead bouncin, fo' hoes want me
Hit the half and give me two dimes for 15
And my mind's on gettin rich by all means
In the trap, cause this rap shit was just my dream

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

"Wasted"
(feat. Plies)



[Hook:]
Rockstar lifestyle mite don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sippin on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning ain't 10 o'clock drinkin
Party party party let's all get wasted
Shake it for me babygirl do it butt naked
I'm so wasted she so wasted
Tell the bartender send me 20 more cases

[Verse 1:]
Living like Witney geekin like Brittney
Gucci no hippy but he stoned like jimmy
Best pill poppas geeked up crazy
Whole click rolling everyone's wasted
Purple codeine sprite pink don't waste it
Mix up grandma drank & then tast it
Now grandma sippin syrup leanin wasted
Walkin around fuck up twistin her finger
Homegirl slipped up drunk got wasted
Now she backstage and she tryin to get famous
She be up drinkin drinkin gucci mane checkin
Club night damn right gucci mane wasted

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Plies]
I Don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm lookin for a bitch ta suck this almond joy
Say she gotta stop suckin cause her jaw sore
Gotta a bitch on the couch bitch on the floor
My partner just pop another one now he rollin more
Was on three pills now he on four
I don't know why but the remy turn me into a whore
Walk into the club pocket full of big faces
Got the .40 on my waist and is off safety
About 40 goons with me and we all wasted
On remy straight tonight dogg no chasin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Whole Click Faded we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelets we white boy wasted
No shirt fuck it I let her see the tatted
We sloppy drunk disgustin and liquour keep wastin
285 eastside Me and plies wasted
Wasting several big booty brawl chasing
Spring bling 50 thousand white girls shakin
Some dancin naked but everyone wasted
Magic city monday ball player wasted
This is for the other drink dustin buds wasted
12 pack wasted I need more cases
And gucci down at oasis all my diamonds caucasion

"Gucci Montana"



Gucci over do's it, does it the boys perfect
Vette piece fronted, its color scale in the cover
I'm up 900 - Goddamn I spent 100
But that's rap money, when trappin' that cash nothin'
I'm internet surfin' to a gorrilla in the turfin
G-Boat racin', jet skin' and golfin'
Crazy color Jordans, same color the bought it
Bitch I'm back, I'm ballin', I'm rich hundred regardless
Shrimp scampy odor everytime I fork chick
Trap nigga conversate with a hundred spark bitch
I'm young rich and heartless, put you on a carton
Cartoon jewelery customized by my artist
6 months lost, got a head start bitch
I was nigga rich ever before I ever got a rap check
Yellow corvette same color bow lett
Pay 20 grands just to get every stone set

Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers

I'm shittin' on these rappers like I'm wearin' a pamper
I'm sittin' on 500s cause I got it together
Niggas never try niggas that set examples
On cocaine shawty, side to side of the scramper
The port of Miami to the streets of Atlanta
The pinky with the lightstone matchin' yo' candle
Gucci Mane La Flare they call me Gucci Montana
My plug from Georgia, Florida make it Tampa, Alabama
My Mississippi niggas feel me harder then Banner
Haters see my video they switchin' the channel
Gucci got pieces, shawty, go get yo' camera
Gucci time is money, bitch so go get it faster
I could give a damn about your father's a pastor
Just cause I smoke your father than your ass is a bastard
Gucci smokin' weed, so you know he's a hazard
Money on my mind, so bitches don't really matter

Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers

Money so big it can't fit in my matress
Never bought the adress cause I signed with Atlantic
Money bigger thirsty then trappin' hispanics
40 in my pocket turn your head into a sandwich
Boss of your boss man, I push the Porsches
Million dollar chain got me feelin' important
Jumped off early and copped me a fork
Makin' mafia money like the king of New York
Gucci go and get it, why them hoes get abortions?
Shittin on a bitch, take a piss on their Jordans
Rap is roverocious, Gucci Mane want the package
Scale in the bag, bitch pay me on the back end
Hamilton's, Washington's, Franklin's and Jackson's
Trapper never trip, I just added the fractions
New bitch muggin' brand new mansion
Everything inside from the jeans to my glasses

Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers

"We Got Dat"
(feat. Chubbie Baby & Titty Boi)



[DJ Holiday:]
(Holiday Season, nigga! Ay!)
What up, Chubbie? Haha!
I see you getting money, nigga!
They say you run Ohio, nigga!
I fuck with you! What up 'Bachi? [?]
Let's go! DJ Holiday!
Shoutout my nigga Tity Boi! My nigga Dolla!
Southside, stand up! We working!
(The Aphilliates, nigga!)
I know what y'all thinking!
Are we ever gon' let up?
Why though? Ain't nobody else gon' do it!
Shit! We getting money, let's go!
(Pay close fuckin' attention!)

[Gucci Mane:]
(Yeahhhh) Everything I drive real fast
Had to let my chick drive 'cause that bitch real bad
First I let her drive it, then I let her ride me
I charged a nigga $40, 000 just to stand beside me
(Yeahhhh) Now that's a stupid check
Gave 40 to Tity Boi and now I got that stupid pack
On I-20 with duffle bags, yeah, I shock a bitch (Chaka)
Two million dollars cash money, damn, man, that's ludicrous
I love to ball with bougie broads, it's big Gucci, yeah I'm a dog
A photoshoot off in the vocal booth, 'nough ice for all of y'all
Ten bricks outta fishscale, same color as Paul Wall
Took off all the burglar bars, you know what we doin', dawg

[Gucci Mane (Chubbie Baby):]
Every day I'm stunting dawg, money ain't really nothin' dawg
Ya boyfriend riding the bus so you need to ride with us, aww
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)
I can't leave that trap alone, he can't leave that trap alone
We can't leave that trap alone, never gon' leave that trap alone
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)

[Chubbie Baby:]
Apple-red coupe, Jolly Rancher rims
63 on the vent, that's a super-charged Benz
With the Big Apple plate and yeah he cost me some ends
New chopper in the trunk that'll chop down ya friends
And my Boost phone jump soon I touch in Columbus
Man, that pearly white on deck, the Northside do numbers
True Religions on my ass, wrist on froze
Me and Gucci hit Velvet and pop thirty Ropes
If you short six grand, man, you getting 30 o's
When I re-up, man, it look like I did thirty shows
In the morning count us doling while you niggas throwing 'bows
And the coupe on autopilot, you see how it floats?

[Gucci Mane (Chubbie Baby):]
Every day I'm stunting dawg, money ain't really nothin' dawg
Ya boyfriend riding the bus so you need to ride with us, aww
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)
I can't leave that trap alone, he can't leave that trap alone
We can't leave that trap alone, never gon' leave that trap alone
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)

[2 Chainz:]
I got that Pyrex vision, all we talk is chickens
I love my stove so much I got a bed in my kitchen
A fine red girl give me head in the kitchen
If a nigga try to rob me, he'll be dead in the kitchen
I'm stunting with my shirt off, my girl like Smirnoff
We get that dough for cheap-cheap, my nigga that's bird talk
Then I pull that 'vert out, I'm with my girlfriend too
Rims so tall it make my car look like it's 6'2"
Smoking on a Vic too, louder than my trunk is
I'm with Gucci Mane, I let Gucci do the ad-libs
Getting to that bread, that check, that mula
We teach you niggas how to stunt, we tutor the juniors

[Gucci Mane (Chubbie Baby):]
Every day I'm stunting dawg, money ain't really nothin' dawg
Ya boyfriend riding the bus so you need to ride with us, aww
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero

(feat. Nicki Minaj)



Girl after girl
Girl after girl
Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls
Girl after girl
Girl after girl
Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls

Me her her and her, grab her by her hair
Naked girls in here, girls touchin on girls
Your lil precious daughter, got her high as hell
Make her pop a pill, still let her hit the blunt till
She feels like I feel, will not just cost a lil
Back round like a hill, these hoes are for real
Me her and her friends, they look like they twins
She so fuckin fine that I touched her up again
Told her next time she can bring her other friend
Then I lost her number never seen again
The best brain in the world, do her thing with a girl
But don't call her yo girl, yo listen I a'int with yo girl

Girl after girl
Girl after girl
Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls
Girl after girl
Girl after girl
Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls

Girl after girl

Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls
Girl after girl

Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls

Poppa, Poppa Bear, I'ma need some honey
Chew it like a gummy, stupid juicy oozy runny
Listen Gucci Mane I got what u need
Keisha and Alisha and Tamika got the weed
Girls everywhere Gucc go and get the camper
White girls too ohh Julie Annie Amber
Can I squeeze your boobs, let me see your boobs
Ain't none of these bitches on my cruising altitude (altitude)
Minaj is the name, it's me and Gucci tag team Wrestlemania brain
I'm stupid uh I'm stupid can u teach me how to read
Lil mami get to flashin get yo Mardi Gras beads

Girl after girl

Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls

"Everything"
(feat. Supa & Yung La)



[Gucci Mane:]

I put change on anybody, 30 40 dead bodies
22's on this, 24's on that
24/7 everyday I'm bout a check

Gucci mane silent but his ice still talking
Sipping lean and rapping call it sleepwalking
Lamborghini creeping on the street like it's tip toeing
Mazeratti cripwalking paint the car orange
Foreign car hood star topless whip I need a bar

"Kitchen Talk (Intro)"



Stepped up my gang first
Stepped up my chain next
Took off that bullshit
Bought me a Rolex
DJ Tell
Iced out my homeboys
Iced out my main bitch
Been 'bout this trap shit
Ice in the grill the brightest
New age, you know what I'm sayin', that's the thing, that's what everyone's doin'
You gotta have a whip, you gotta have a house
Young, rich, black boy with talent
Gucci Mane, brick man, God damnit
Any beef come to me, I handle it
Gucci hot and they can't stand it
Drop tops, all ice we got
Hundred dollar rocks-

"Pussy Nigga"
(feat. Nicki Minaj)



[Gucci Mane:]
I smell ya, nigga, you a failure
You pussy to me, hell ya
I think you a failure, you rookie to me
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
I smell ya, nigga, you a failure
You pussy to me, hell ya
I think you a failure, you rookie to me
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga

See I'm the boss of bosses so please proceed with caution
Jewelry cost a fortune, my financial consultants
My 9 o'clock appointment, smokin' in ma office
Sippin on a latte, the speaker phone I'm talkin' (Hello)
Five thousand dollar jeans a quarter brick is balkin'
Chicken for a feature, but we feel that it's a bargin
The bezzle on my Bentley, wash it off just like a biscuit
Gucci Mane you pussies better bring security
Pitty you don't pitty me boy go join a sorority
So Icey the minority, it's Gucci the priority
[?]
Pounds of weed and ecstasy, my jewelry [?] is prejudice
Gucci Mane, So Icey boy, shinin' like a lighting bolt
Light bulb chandelier, lunar sun solar exclipes
Gucci man the blizzard, pussy wetter take a load of him
Pussy nigga, see a pussy nigga, slap a pussy nigga

I smell ya, nigga, you a failure
You pussy to me, hell ya
I think you a failure, you rookie to me
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
I smell ya, nigga, you a failure
You pussy to me, hell ya
I think you a failure, you rookie to me
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga

[Nicki Minaj:]
You're pussier than my lollipop picture
I be up top pussy poppin' on the Gixter
Pop ya kickstand, little mama, I'm the Nicster
I'll pop you then I'll pop your little sister
You're pussier than a strip club dancer
Maybe Wayne shoulda called you the pussy monster
Pussy goin' bonkers, fuck is my bouncers
Niggas payin bucks to see my pussy at my concert
Pussy dis, pussy dat, pussy thick, pussy fat
Break me off a piece a dat, pussy-kit, pussy-kat
I smell pussy, get a pussy-tic pussy-tac
Wait, matter fact you are running from a pussy rat
See a pussy, slap a pussy and tell 'em that's the pussy
My pussy from another planet got that NASA pussy
I'm Minaj, that's Gucci, that's Wayne
Yeah, you coochie, stop playin'

[Gucci Mane:]

Now I'm in the 6, I used to ride with verse [?] man
Yellow Corvette, same color as your teeth is
Underneath the brush they don't [?] on my yellow rims
Hundred bricks, rushed them, straight to the G state
Then I got the motherfuckin' Philly ass cheesesteak
Bar grill and my grill look like the family grill
Got your bitch on three or four X pills
Hundred G's, two hundred G's, fuck a record deal
Two mil, three four mil, give me your record deal
I'm worth a couple mil in jewelry, a couple mil
And I don't fuck around with Jimmy, nigga, think a nigga slipping
MAC 90, double clip, a banana, I'm bananas
I kill 'em when I hit 'em, I'm the young Tony Montana, bitch
In the middle of the EA, GA
Fifth ward? no man I'm Zone 6 affiliated
Bouldercrest originated, cremated, the last way
Any nigga who tried me, burn one, blast one

Yeah
Yeah, its Gucci
What's happenin', it's ya boy!
Pimp so hard, nigga
Pimp so hard
Swag up, nigga, boss up, nigga
Man up
Gucci Mane, La Flare, put your chin down

I don't do the push up I do the kush up
I'm booked up, look up "Gucci," overbook me
Shawty gone stupid, diamonds, look Cupid
Red diamond shawty, floor, just overdo it
Supersized watch, baby check out the bezel
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I'm ahead of the schedule
My Learjet flyin' G5, shawty
Red mic, and shawty, no Levis
Hi, I'm so fly, I'm DUI and I don't know why I drive
But, I'm suicide, my doors up like a Lamb
It's Gucci Mane, La Flare, call me gamblin' Sam
Fruit Loop, I'm Toucan Sam
Gucci Mane, I gives no damn
I'm fly as fuck 'cause I'm so kushed up
And I'm so drawn up, and I sip that lean
And I smoke that green, do you know what I mean?
Don't snort no white but I sell that shit
Man I got that Chanel, man them bricks exist
Right here in the 6, right there exit
You the exit, right there, I'm Zone 6
[?] got the seventy-four O's, I restarted it bitch
In the store, it's horrific, flow so horrific
I glorified it, sex and violence, man I supply it
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I'm a firebreathin' dragon
Your girl diggin' me, show to her clique I'm attractive
Gucci, nigga, boy I go crazy
My diamonds ain't clouded, they never been hazy
Shawty got a chain on, but it don't amaze me
You spent five grand, I spent one-eighty
Hey, pay me! Fuck you, pussy nigga, don't play me!
I don't give a damn 'cause I get money
I don't talk crazy, I just talk country and funky
Bunky, I be stitchy, stanky, stunky, skunky, bunky (Huh?)
Booster-ass bitch, you can get the fuck from 'round me
Gucci Mane, La Flare, you can sign here

Icy money, man, bar season on deck, man, stick boys on deck, man
Thirty two entertainment, I do this shit for the hood, blood in blood out, my clique, my nigga
What's happenin' nigga, East Atlanta we stand out, nigga Zone 6 affiliate, Bouldercrest originated
Get cremated, decapitated, you bitch
Burn one

A hundred bales of kush, you can't even smell me rookie
I got case to vape, I turn coke to cookie
Lookie, lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes Gucci
My bar so sound so I just overdo it
Duece is dab and painted orange on my McClaren
Green color carriage, got the favorite cutie starin'
I'm sprayin' with nobody, I'm signed with nobody
I count my own money, I make my own money
I own my own publishing, check in for a feature
I stack for my mortgage, twelve hundred for my sneakers
Reefer keep her cockin desert eagles for my people
Reefer keep her cockin desert eagles for my people
I got [?] eagles and dubs, corners and people
Them birdies your uncle didn't get
Pound cans of spinach
Flip jugs of X, liters'll let rain
Avalanche of white, a million bales of green
I said g-g-g-g-I've me a brick
Fuck a bitch, all I need is a gun and a clip
I said g-g-g-g-I've me a brick
Fuck a bitch, all I need is the motherfuckin' 6, nigga
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme a brick
I'ma take them down, break them down with my clique
Go in, them re-rock, them bring back
Serve them to the lame ass niggas for the stack
OJ, what's up, what's up, what's up, wait
Gucci, my grill, presses, cuttin'
Slick boy, you know they wouldn't leave
It's the S-O-I-C-Y-A-G, you see?
I-M-A-E-E, he so damn fly
Who is his stylist, the boy be wilin'
He playful on the mic, man the boy so childish

When I met [?] real talk man, where my hundreds and fifties, dawg
I'm cashin' out

I'm goin' to the brick man and cashin' out (Krill)
I'm goin' to the brick man and cashin' out
I'm goin' to the nigga with the large amount
Front me with a pie and them I'm cashin' out
I'm going' to the brick man with a large amount, I gave him all my bands, said, "I'm cashin' out"
I'm going' to the brick man with a large amount, don't fuck with me dawg, I know that you heard me
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, I made a mil on Thursday
Forty two bricks, call them James Worthy
Thirty three bricks, call them Scotty Pipen
Tenty three, MJ, nigga you slippin'
Sixteen five, round it to seventeen
Quincy Carter for the bricks, come shop with me
Eighteen down, nineteen, ten [?]

Thirty four P's, that's bojack
When I put it in the pot, man it gon' come back
I got the bullfrog yay 'cause its gon' jump
I got six twelve squares in my God damn [?]
And I'm rollin' on them sixes in The 6
Got the Gucci print printed all on my bitch
Keep the blaze attitude, they'll make it right
Foxy lady, they ain't hit nothin' but hurricane
But go on, [?]
Damn, I don't need no hip
Mr. Floyd he's filthy just to ice my belt
Damn, the boy just so reckless
I gave him a quarter just to do my necklace
Damn, and I know they hate it
Gave Floyd sixty just to make my bracelet
Reload the matrix, hurt y'all faces
Its Gucci Mane La Flare and I don't date chicks
I take it to the tele and buy 'em some furniture
Get her makeup just like monica
It's Gucci Mane the monster man the band man Gucci
I heard Gucci Mane is wearin' nothin but Gucci
I hear Gucci Mane wore Louis mixed with Gucci
Its Gucci Mane La Flare everything I overdo it

"Gone Hate"
(feat. Q6)



[Gucci Mane & Q6:]
Yeah, It's Gucci
Nigga this Gucci, nigga
Mixtape shit, freestyle man, no feds watching me
Freestyle with us, nigga
Bread now, this DVD shit

[Gucci Mane:]
I'ma tell you like it's just another day in the East Atlanta, 6
Just a young nigga in the hood sellin' bricks
Just another nigga, just another clique
Just another girl, man, you're just another bitch
It's just another day in the East Atlanta, 6
You're chosin' me, so you're on a dope man's dick
You're chosin' me, so you're on a dope man's dick

Yellow Corvette, that's the dope man's drive
Blue and white [?], that's the dope man watch
Bouldercrest Road, that's the dope man's block
Dope man, dope man, can I please call?
Police try and tell the dope man, "Stop!"
The dope man thinkin', "Man I gotta make a nine"
Your trap kinda slow, I'ma make the trap hot
Waka Flocka Flame, tell flow to bring the chopper
I'me throw, throw, you back, back, back to '89
Moved to Atlanta, Georgia, I was just 9
Mountain Park Apartment, everybody on the grind
Then I moved to Sun Valley, everybody had a nine
Went to school, 11, with a motherfuckin' knife
When I was 13, I got my first strike
Got my first stripe, it's Gucci Mane, La Flare
Kush smokin', joint smokin', put it in the air
Nigga this a hood affair, every hood everywhere
When you hear this in your car, you gon' want to pull a chair up
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I be ridin' in the lair
I be so iced up, I be so kushed up
Man I wanna be like Gucci when I grow up
All I wanna do is buy a pound and then get drow'd up
Alls you wanna do is buy a ball and get snowed up
I tell her that I got her, 'cause I know that she a shopper
Shawty want an 8-ball, tell her, "Call Waka"
Shawty want a [?], tell her, that don't got her
I'm gonna [?], shopping like a burglar
Gucci Mane, La Flare, and the track gets murdered
Gucci! It's Gucci! It's Gucci!

"Bricks (Remix)"
(feat. OJ da Juiceman, Fabolous, 8Ball & MJG, Shawty Lo)



[Gucci Mane:]
Huh, huh
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Ay, Holiday, Juiceman
Light-tan bricks
Ah man you got everyone on this one, cause, this the remix
Juiceman gon' start this one off though, let's go
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!
Thirty-six zips
DJ Holiday, this is for the streets, Fabulous, Shawty Lo 8Ball and MJG
That's a whole chick
Want a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits
But I still take bricks

[OJ da Juiceman:]
Brick, hundred fifty bricks man
Young Juiceman with my bricks out the trash can
White baby, tan baby, no I'm not a gravy baby
We started in Georgia, pappin', young Juice, '98
Right wrist real retarded, dawg, right hand just replaced the J
Bust it, break it down, now Juiceman got the stupid [?]
Twerkin' fifty bricks now left wrist switched like the Lakers
Catch me in my Hummer and I'm taller than a damn glacier
Pinky ring, forty stacks, bought it with that con back
All these, just a gram, got my diamonds just like jumping jacks
Young Juiceman, God damn, you boomin'
All these bricks in, I ain't blow in the movies

[Gucci Mane:]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!

[Fabulous:]
Chickens came through, all white me
It's time to kill these hoes, get the white sheets
Back seat bricks, chauffeur drippin'
Now there's birds on the table, happy Thanksgiving
Daddy do the duffel, shorty do the speed
Big first week numbers, I ain't sell a CD
We flip squares, welcome to White Castle
She say I'm ballin' like a bitch, ho, did I ask you?
He's low, so, 'case you didn't know so
If you don't you know now
They should call me snow plow
All white, just like, but you know I took ten
These gon' go for double when I get 'em back to Brooklyn

[Gucci Mane:]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!
Thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick
Want a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits
But I still take bricks

[8Ball & MJG:]
I'm wrapped up in all dirty types of shit, so
This the dirty game, give me thirty six domes
I'm tight, MJ with the big foams
Four cock backs, baby tryna get more
You don't know about the pistol on the [?]
You try to catch me slippin', make me try to pop a ho
Stupid nigga, try to catch me on the smooth creek
You know I'd never keep nothin' where a nigga sleeps
That's where you gotta eat, where everything is sweet
You Dwayne Wade? You wanna bring the heat?
Bricks on the block, bricks in the trap
And when you ridin' keep a couple bricks in your lap
Don't get your feelings hurt thinkin' this is just a rap
You heard- you know where they do that at
Bitches love money, niggas make money
You not a hustler, motherfucker, you a crash dummy

[Gucci Mane:]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!

[Shawty Lo:]
All-white bricks, off-white bricks
At the bay, switch J's, so hood rich
Like ten bricks, sold 'em ASAP
To my Carolina boys, made a full cap
Ay, bricks like [?]
Beat the work up like I beat Tina
Nigga fly as hell
Got the thing swimming like Michael Phelps
Ay, and I don't need no medal
Chain so big, it's the size of your kid
Dun, dun, dun, done what you did
You ain't man like me and Gucci, servin' ya bricks

[Gucci Mane:]

I got the stove on, and get the pie... hot
It's fin' to get hot
So put your mask on, and lick some shots... hot
It's fin' to get hot

Man the whip gon' be a cold summer
Ice on my Bentley so that means I got a cold stormer
(YEAHHH!) And my watch it cost a cool hundred
Ch'all cost me two hundred flexin with the new money
Brr - got that don't know what to do money
Put it in the 7, got my old school lookin too funny
Hahaha, and this paint job cost a cool twenty
Gotta watch my 2 junkies, burnin on that good chronic
Huh? A flat 40 and my rim Mikey
Try to CEO I leave you flunky like a damn donkey
Geah, I hope you heard what I just said homey
Thought you were my dog 'til that nigga put the fes on me
So nigga go and tell on me
I'ma get this bread homey, I ain't never scared homey
Huh? Hope you heard what I just said homey
You can go and tell on me, I'ma get this bread homey

[Chorus]

In the club on that good burnin
Shorty smokin weed but it smellin like that wood burnin
Stop! In Magic City on a good Monday
Got it rainin good money, hoes make it good for me
Go go go, I told lil' momma what she could do for me
Shorty kept it hood, lil' momma out here catchin jewels for me
I told my flunkie need to see somethin
Shorty she don't ride but she took G down to the 10 for me
Uhh, and I let her get it in for me
Comin through the outfit right now strapped down with them things for me
Uhh, and that girl know how to spend money
Baby want that real money, show you how to lay in money
(Yeahhh!) I told her all I do is cash hundreds
Lookin like that cash money, out here makin fast money
Uhh, but nigga if you trick your last money
If you trick your last money, nigga you a damn dummy

[Chorus]

I hit the club, gon' leave my car runnin
Why you leave your car runnin? I'm just gon' be five minutes

It did take me 9 minutes, but I needed 9 jimmies
(Yeahhh!) Make these girls grant all my 9 wishes
All you player haters need to get the fuck out my bid'ness
Uhh, man I think I got 'bout 9 Hemmes

Geah, geah, Juice

Whassup Juan T? Boss Lady?
Geah, E.A., E.A., E.A., I mean

This a block party nigga, you serve the blocks nigga
or you ain't comin nigga, geah, Atlanta

[Chorus 2X:]
It's my party, buy a dub if you want to
30 if you want to, 40 then I front you
A block on a plate, take a line if you want to
You know that you want to, I know what'chu gonna do

10 and a half, 30 bags in a drought (Gucci!)
Gucci run the 6 with a pot in the vault
Hey yeah I roll, hey yeah I steal
Hey yeah I smoke drink and pop pills (yeah)
Nigga this my party, where do you live? (Huh?)
Who let you in, how'd you get here?
Gucci go bonkers, man the flow's monster
Old folks wonder how I ride Hummer
Corvette, old school, Verte look like Tonka
Fo' deep gangsta, negro wood rocker
Chopper, flames jump out just like Flocka
Nigga drop us be missin like Jimmy Hoffa

[Chorus]

Eskimos baby, where the igloo at?
I'm double if you cut me my wet might leak out
Million dollar traphouse, and I just cashed out (whassup Juice?)
Got the red car cause it can't mace{?} out
And I bring packs out, thrice house, sex out
It's my block, this where them feds get slammed out (yeah)
and issue that crack out (yeah) two chicks at my crack house (yeah)
Can I suck your dick? Hell nah you junkie bitch
Can't touch my work or dick your worthless piece of shit
I'm up three million, and that's just here licks
I sell white icks, on to that bass bricks
Save your compartment, save the deposit
Glock no safety, I already cocked it
Gucci two bands, can't fit in a wallet
I'm all 'bout the profit, the feds keep watchin
Gucci two bands, can't fit in a wallet
I'm all 'bout the profit, the feds keep watchin (Gucci)

[Chorus]

I turned my Glock, to a Mac, with a 30 round clip
Everybody step back, I'm fin' to let this fucker rip
Nigga don't slip, sniper rifle equal
Street sweeper hit that ass here the bill on the igloo
Buy the tips, and the Glock, bet that sink your battleship
Pussy bwoy, musta thought, Gucci Mane wouldn't rip
Who the hell you think I am? Musta thought I was a bitch
Last time I took a piss, man I knew I had a dick - PUSSY!

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Stoopid"



See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Send on my jacky baby, call her terry bracelet baby
Bart one was spent 'bout 20 G, Gucci drop three eighty baby
Multicolor carrot tee, my necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain

Mighty mouse is icy dog, Bart shit is just stupid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance stones, pink is like a movie
Truly I'm a walkin' lick, Gucci man the talkin' brick

If you ain't gonna talk to chickens dog who you talkin' to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate, Nate about to go to school
Saturday I'm cookin' chickens, momma about to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin' chickens, granny about to go to church

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Heavy wrist activity got me livin' lovely
Cocka nina, heaven land, cocka nina shawty
Breakin' down ten chickens, dog about to cook the shake up
All these extra grams might as well go buy a Jacob

Gucci man for mayor, Gucci man so player
Repin' East Atlanta, that's ten minutes from Decatur
Almost match are cars and are belts going to match are gators
You can't swang like Gucci 'cause you don't got enough flavor

Heavy on the lickerish, industry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate

Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

My girlfriend say she love me but it's just the jewelry
Multicolor carrots got your girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verses and then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth back to my trap, you know I'm mournin'

'74 restored it, Beethoven recorded
Say you charging 30 like that Gucci can't afford it
Gucci chargin' 40 dog, that's a couple birdies
Gucci stoopid jewelry dog, I don't think you herd me

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Murder For Fun"
(feat. Ox)



[Intro: Ox]
Ital, original Don Dada say
The motherfuckin saga just begun
WARNING! Warning, cinder boots
Sunk in the mud, I am

[Chorus: Ox]
(Killin, killin, killin) The original, WAR! So
Kill dem pussy, we kill dem fi fun
Killin a pussy, we kill dem fi fun
Killin pussy, we kill dem fi fun
Send a man, no mind our business or die tonight
Or tell him ass again that 'im end soon come
Before 'im come, mi Gucci Mane come
Before 'im come, de Don Dada come
When we come, it's a battle gun come
Pussy gwan see we, and started to run
But - nowhere to 'ide, me-say nowhere to run
Infrared light might dead 'pon we gun
See 'im place the spot them a dead 'im fall down so
Kill him pussy, we kill dem fi fun
Killin a pussy, kill dem fi fun

[Gucci Mane]
Man I murder fo' fun but my job is never done
From morning morn' to the setting of the sun
Bad men come come, come get murdered for fun
The hundred round drum in my tommy gun
Be a cat in the Hum' I'll cut out your tongue
Me and Ox, man we murder fo' fun
Talk talk bad man, come get murdered fo' fun
The Gucci Mane, man I murder fo' fun
See my momma ain't raised no bitch-ass nigga
Never heard Gucci Mane no snitch-ass nigga
When you dealin with a vet, don't bring a rookie
Tell Young Jeezy that I smell pussy
The top shotter with the Don Dada
The whole hood is a done daddah
M holla to the state of Nevada
Put a hole in your fuckin oblongota pussy

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Big Cat is a Army, better yet a Navy
Try to kill Gucci Mane, bitch it ain't crazy
Tell Jeezy it's a bullet with his name on it
A ten thousand dollar hit, he put my chain on it
Ye ain't heard about it? You ain't seen the news?
Ye ain't read the paper? You fuckin player hater
Bird brain-ass nigga perpetratin the boss
Might think you won one but you really done lost, bitch!

[Chorus]

"Trap Money (Remix)"
(feat. B.A. & Mook)



[Chorus 2X: Gucci Mane]
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap [2X]
I got 20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hoe and that's really trap money

[B.A.]
B.A.!!
Blue lights flashin, checkin out my mansion
Gangster so flashy, Louis Vuitton magnum
How he out here swaggin? Dat be what they askin
I drop the white crease, call it dope boy magic
Dopeology, you should take one of my classes
Hit me in the hood, red carpet, pants saggin
Rob you on Front Street in 75 classic
My potnahs know I'm good in the hood besides rappin
I got trap money cabin, it's 30 if you askin
D trap money lavish, ain't gotta make it rappin
Fruity bezel the cabbage, them country niggaz taxin
Ballin like Maverick, blowin loud in the traffic
I robbed a nigga twosie in some Rap Lord fashion
Say young'n in the hood, I'm a trap money addict
Cartier glasses, you see that I got money
I wake up early in the mornin I need me some trap money

[Chorus]

[Mook]
Mook!
20 Benz back, you see a nigga, that's my pack money
Look I ain't got no record deal so no it ain't no rap money
You see the stack in my jeans, I can't fit no rubber band
22 on cents, I'ma wrap it 'round them
And first I unload the tractor, bust 'em out the wrapper
Get 'em to my trappers and they bring me back them rat chicks
Bust off goin fast, you can call it cheetah girl
When I get the panky you know I'm water whippin her
No top on the whip, tank top Louis V
You can call me tank top cause all I do is wifebeat
Talkin smart on the phone, price just gone up
Take it or leave it homeboy, either way I give a fuck
Pot cold, LB's, kush by the O-Z's
Yeah I sell 'em for the low and get 'em for the dirt cheap
Get in just how you want, I'm a walkin trap sto'
Well connected nigga courtesy of my amigos
Flyin down 20 East, trunk full of dirty birdies
In the middle of the drought we let them bitches fly for 30
In the kitchen cuttin work I gotta do my two-step
Yeah I'm bad leg trappin, bring it to your front stop
Now I'm on Y-65, just got off I-10
In the handicap van, fill it up with midgets man
I mean the good I know is show and it ain't come from rappin money
Ten bands, all tens, nigga that's my trap money

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Neva Had Shit"



[Intro]
Yup! Yup!
Gucci Mane in this motherfucker (Gucci Gucci)
My nigga Zo' on the track (my nigga Zo')
That real shit, that real shit

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggaz talkin 'bout me
but they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

I ain't never had shit nigga that's the truth
Rich kids in the school used to draw on my shoes
Name stayed on the board, fo' checks in chalk
In detention cause the teacher say that we can't talk
Counselor raggin and my momma got that I just walk
I wish I had a nickel for every fight I fought
Stealin candy out the sto' like I can't get caught
Just a lil' bad black boy, it ain't my fault
After school snack syrup and fo' pieces of bread
Granddaddy why yo' eyes so God damn red?
"Got a real soft ass and a hard-ass head
Better mind your fuckin manners boy," that's what he said

[Chorus]

I moved to East Atlanta at the age of 9
Real cold winter, 1989
My brother good at ball, I can't play no sports
They won't let you pack a tool on the b-ball court
Cluster Ave, Monty Paul, where my daddy now?
Things goin alright, we a family now
Got the dopeman Nikes and the Starter coat
Only nigga in school with the dopeman rope
Pull the joint two times, man I'm high already
I like that girl with them braids and them high-top Chevys
Got that bump for stick-up, Starter and the big boy chest
Tried to take it on the train but I just couldn't let him

[Chorus]

14 gettin drunk at a house party
They locked me up, they must have hid a half a ounce on me
Momma mad as a mother', daddy let him be
Gucci Mane, raised me to be a straight up G 
Now my daddy hustle hard, but he love sum liquor
And my momma wanna leave him but she love the nigga
Everything kinda changed when I turned 16
Got the old school Regal with the chrome back rings
Like a newborn baby, man that bitch clean
But the motor fucked up and the transmission
and it's knockin down the street with the 415's
In Mackmile parkin lot, stright whipping
And I'm Bankhead bouncin, fo' hoes want me
Hit the half and give me two dimes for 15
And my mind's on gettin reach by all means
In the trap, cause this rap shit was just my dream

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Big Cat Records

[Chorus]
Diamonds hello yellow fellow
Mellow yellow diamond bezel
Aqua water, toilet water
Pissin yellow, shit mellow
Club light, club night
Shorty got a hella chain
Hella cake, hella fame
Drop top Corvette yellow thang

DeVille on the watch, chain, earring and ring shit
Hangin with the dope boys, cause they on the same shit
Blues got evicted, shorty think she seein things
Boy, I start on a skateboard and he skate man
Dope, be 180 mane, got these rappers hatin mane
Got it fo' Atlanta mane, brought it out my trappin game
Whole lot of traffic mane, bein mojo, stackin change
Tattoo of that yellow rang, shorty got a yellow chain

[Chorus]

Cracy color cherry chain, same color my baby ass
Sellin white and smokin green, shiny yellow diamond cream
Time to work no time to play, every day I'm off in yay
Usin cocallina, choosin demi jewelry, boss excused
{?} runnin, scare a cover, ketchup stones and yellow mustard
Red, black and green bright, call the piece the motherland
All white earring, cost me damn near 80 grand
Five time zone change, what's the time in Pakistan?
Homeboy got a leather belt, Gucci flood it platinum belt
Crazy color karats, bitch went platinum, call it kuatinum
Shorty drunk just chewin his stacks, say that boy quadruple that
Gucci draw 200 ranks, how he gon' keep up with that?

[Chorus]

Scoopy fruity icey part, the piece that'll change your heart
Gucci Mane up in your part, border diamonds yellow market
Ice stones, ringtone, green stones, cell phone

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Get Low (Like A Lambo)"
(feat. Selassie)



[Intro: Selassie]
Ay! DJ Speedy (Speedy)
You a fool for this one (for this one)
Selassie, Ice (Ice)
We still, rock steady (rock steady)
Gucci Mane, where you at?

[Gucci Mane]
YEAHHH! I'm not your baby daddy
I'm your sugar daddy, too much money on me
I can buy you all drinks, everything is on me
You can smoke and eat free, I'm in the V-I-P
Baby come and see me, G-U double-C I
M-A-N-E, I'm (So Icey)
You done heard about me, but enough about me
Let's talk about we, come lie on my sheets
I'ma lay in you deep, like a Lamborghini
Girl you represents me, and you must look cute
Cause you represent me, I'm the President Bill
You my Hilary, but you try an' diss me
I'ma call on whiskey, need a black lady
independent Oprah Winfrey, ask Oprah Winfrey
Has she heard about me? Spread the word about me
If you leave your plan A, I can be your plan B
Gucci!

[Chorus: Selassie]
Lambo, like a Lambo
Get low to the earth like a Lambo
Baby stick your hands up like a Lambo
Go slow, go fast like a Lambo
Oh she looks like a Lambo, like a Lambo
Baby body bangin harder than a Lambo
Baby put her hands up like a Lambo
She remind me of a Murcielago

[Gucci Mane]
Like a Lamborghini, shorty very pricey
She can be your wifey could say that shorty might be
But I think she like me, least I think she like G's
All the G's on her bag, how she couldn't like me?
(Gucci) How she wouldn't like me? Your man wanna bite me
But he shouldn't, now you runnin like a Lamborghini
Shorty fine as a scene, Jet beauty this week
She as top notch as Jet, but she a stone cold freak
Ridin down to South Beach, 'bout 4 or 5 drinks
Jumped in a 'Lago, doors up, you don't say
Gucci Mane, Selassie, girl we extra ic-ey
Wanna owe it to Atlanta, pussy nigga don't say
I'ma pay like I weigh, every day my payday
Every day our payday, we in the Lamborghini
I'ma pay like I weigh, every day my payday
Every day our payday, we in the Lamborghini

[Chorus]

[Selassie]
And she know she good, when she up in the hood
Because she got that good, that's what they say in the hood
Yeah so you can ask Mr. Gucci, excuse me, Mr. Icey
Baby girl yeah say she wanna be your wifey
She dress real pricey, her head game nice B
Plus she says she got a girl who like me

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Say Damn"



[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The way my wrist glist' I make a hood bitch say "Damn!"
My neck-lace represent the fact I go ham
It's lonely up here, man I need to come down
So many O's I made the bank teller pass out

My trap house floors lookin like a Magic City Monday
But ain't no singles, it's just big head hundreds
My car's gettin watched by this ugly-ass junkie
I keep laughin like a woman but it ain't shit funny (ha)
I'm posted in the trap and my country boys comin
I'm hood rich bitch, still servin two dummies
I'm gettin on your nerves cause Gucci got money
The charm is absurd but the rims are all shiny

[Chorus]

I mic check, I mic check, now it's time the chicken talk
One scratch on my Nike checks, I cop another pair
I got stacks on deck, make the girl break her neck
when she hit the bubble kush the bitch coughed up her breakfast
I'm the realest make a bet, I bet the checks don't bounce
So much cash in the bag I make accountants lose count
Your girl say she love to see a thug iced out
With me and Speedy on the track it's the return of chicken talk
Gucci!

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Cuttin' Off Fingaz"



Geah [echoes], Gucci [echoes]
Gucci Mane, LaFlare, yeah
(A lot of niggaz thought we couldn't have pulled it off Gucci)
(But, guess what, we here, we sellin units)
(We doin real big AND we eatin, the whole plate)
The whole fuckin plate man; ain't no cuts on this shit man
Ain't no middleman in this shit, we want all the fuckin money man
We get all the money, independent where it's at man
I'ma tell y'all independents like this
If you want the blueprint to this shit, watch Gucci Mane

Gucci overdooz it, does it, the boy's perfect
Neck piece flooded, it's color scattered and covered
I'm worth nine hundred God damn I spent a hundred
But that's rap money, when trappin that cash nothin
I'm internet surfin, tourin grillin and turfin
Speedboat racin, jet skiing and golfin
Crazy color Jordans, same color the ballin
Bitch I bet up on it, I'm rich my dear regardless
Shrimp scampi odor every time I flaunt chick
Trap nigga conversate, with a Harvard smart bitch
I'm young rich and heartless, put you on a carton
Cartoon jewelry customized by my artist
Six months locked, got a head start bitch
I was nigga rich befo' I ever got a rap check
Yellow Corvette same color Moet
Paid twenty grand just to get every stone set

Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

I'm shittin on these rappers like I'm wearin a Pamper
I'm sittin on five hundred cause I got it together
Niggaz never try niggaz that set examples
I'ma eat a shawty sunnyside or the scramble
The port of Miami, to the streets of my 'lanta
The pinkie with the light stone match your encounter
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, they call me Gucci Montana
I'm Boston, Georgia, Florida, Macon, Tampa and 'Bama
My Mississipi niggaz feel me harder than Banner
Haters see my video they switchin the channel
Gucci got pieces, shawty go get'cha camera
And Gucci time is money bitch, so go get it faster
Cause I could give a damn about your father's a pastor
Because I smoke your father then yo' ass is a bastard
Gucci smokin weed, so you know he's a hazard
Money's on my mind, bitches don't really matter

Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

My money so big it can't fit in my matress
Devil bought the actress cause I signed with Atlantic
One fifty cursin while trappin in Spanish
Forty in my pocket turn yo' head to some Manwich
Boss of your boss man, I push the Porsches
My million dollar chain got me feelin important
Jumped off early and copped me a fort
Major moves with money like the (King of New York)
Gucci go and get it while them hoes get abortions
Shittin on a bitch, take a piss on they Jordans
Rappers want promotion, Gucci Mane want the package
The scale in the bag, bitch pay me on the back end
Hamiltons and Washingtons, Franklins and Jacksons
Trapper never trip, I just added the fractions
New bitch waggin, brand new mansion
And everything designer from my jeans to my glasses

Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Shittin' Onum"



[Intro]
[sound of a fly buzzing around]
Hot damn! Hot, hot, stankin hot
A steerin wheel charm 'bout the size of a dinner plate

[Chorus]
Too many VVS, and when you see you got to say
("Gawwwwd damn! Sheeeeeeit!")
Is your lights on? (Yeah) Iced on (Yeah)
Diamonds on my chest my name right on my wrist my fist
it be like ("Gawwwwd damn!")
All the hoes sayin ("Sheeeeeeit!")
Then the niggaz be like diamonds on the chest thick
Wrist, arm, fist, man, Gucci Mane, LaFlare, he the shit

Gucci Mane in the party, bump whoa Kemosabe
So sick with the words think I need chemotherapy
No simpleton, but this beat, it's a sicken them
Gucci Mane the maestro but you should take a whiff of it
Halloween down to chain, hoes wanna trick or treat
Brother trick it off, 'fore I take yo' bitch out to eat
Buyin chain so foolish, girl I spent a hundred G's
I can trick my brightland then, and, get a hundred G's
Hundred G's ain't nothin to me, I need least two thousand ki's
Where are those two thousand pizzas it been dry out here a week
Laugh not for the kid dawg, twenty thousand for a fee
Ten cars, got a fleet, I done rolled and everything

[Chorus]

See the second verse better so get your air freshener
Wanna be like Gucci? Little buddy eat your vegetables
I'm on another level, I'm Gucci Boosay
Gucci boots were purchased 'fore they came out schedule
Thirty-five thou' just to come to your house
say happy birthday, ate cake and bounced out
Now Gucci is a drought, whereabout, not in this house
Pills pills powder traphouse like a drug sto'
Never too much, I'm the shit, like the commode
Toilet stool breath ass girl, you need to back up
Shawty so fine she need to slow it up, slow it up
Shawty showin legs but she still ain't seen enough

[Chorus]

Speedy, Gucci
The So Icey boys baby girl, see our diamond watches
All the girls are jockin cause they know, that my diamonds poppin
Floppin, flies around me, cause they know that Gucci's funky
Toppin, and bossin, and save the posses for the runnin
AK-47, is still, what's shakin for me
So Icey squad pussy nigga, we cross the country
See I'm the man, bland pussy nigga we the army
We made a plan, and, and, look we formed a company
So mad, told y'all that we gettin money
Every day they cocky, and dirty laundry
1500, just to clean my garbage
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I'm from the projects

[Chorus]

[Outro]
("Gawwwwd damn! Sheeeeeeit!")
[flies buzzing]
("Gawwwwd damn! Sheeeeeeit!")
[fades out]

And the mirror said:

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Dope Boys"



All Nas need is one mic, all I need is one stove
Homie got a nice flow but gucci got that white coke
You ain't getting the right dope, you knocking on the wrong door
Last nigga tried me, let's just call him John Doe
And since you short a dime homie then park me a old school
I fronted you, you ran off that's not what you're supposed to do
I'm gettin my tip fade cut Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm Brisco
Yeah, Gucci mane's a live wire
Try me like I'm Yung Berg and I'mma make yo eyes cry
Gucci like to drank, and Gucci like to smoke
And Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke
GUCCI! (Gucci Mane's a G')
Tell me something I don't know
I got court in early morning I don't really wanna go
I do this for the people cause I'm my brother's keeper
I don't feel you cause I'm paraplegic, where's my paralegal

See that house right there, yeah make a lot a money
(Who's that knocking at the door?)
Probably a couple junkies
That coupe over there, yeah cost a couple hundreds
See my neighborhood is bunkin tell my plug to keep it coming
Dope boys, dope boys with the dope boss
Dope boys, dope boys with the dope boss
What you wanna get homie hurry up and buy it
Dopeboys gone buy you gon' get yourself supply

I'm in my M6 Beemer, this is no 645
Like a pigeon in the sky, I just shitted on your ride
So much weight off in my house, you would think it was a gym
Plus my Nikes match my necklace and my necklace match my rims
I got court in early morning I don't really wanna go
Say I violated probation just because I blew my nose
Blew 300 on my Rolls
200 more on the Lamb
Million dollars on the crib
Car note, don't know what that is
Gucci, you don't know who that is
Mama that's just Gucci Mane, that's my boy that's my partner
I'm Gucci Mane biggest fan
Plus she don't know what that is
I'm with that I don't give a damn
If you think I give a fuck you must do not know who I am, Gucci

See that house right there, yeah make a lot a money
(Who's that knocking at the door?)
Probably a couple junkies
That coupe over there, yeah cost a couple hundreds
See my neighborhood is bunkin tell my plug to keep it coming
Dope boys, dope boys with the dope boss
Dope boys, dope boys with the dope boss
What you wanna get homie hurry up and buy it
Dopeboys gone buy you gon' get yourself supply

Mirror mirror mirror
Who the realest in the game?
(Why you ask that stupid question
Boy you know that's Gucci Mane)
East Atlanta 6
You know how we roll
I just bought another Chevy got it right back out the bowl
Tall stacks up in my closet I can't even see my clothes
And my belly get so big I can hardly see my toes
Got a car in my garage I have never ever drove
It's a four-door black on black Phantom I call that bitch Dorrough
If she going to the ladies room I guess I'll let her know
I got powder in my living room, so she don't have to stroll
A year ago today, I was sitting in my cell
(Where you see yourself in 5 years?)
A so icey billionare
Gucci!

See that house right there, yeah make a lot a money
(Who's that knocking at the door?)
Probably a couple junkies
That coupe over there, yeah cost a couple hundreds
See my neighborhood is bunkin tell my plug to keep it coming
Dope boys, dope boys with the dope boss
Dope boys, dope boys with the dope boss

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Frowney Face"



Homie just texted me
Say my nigga flexed him
Dummy brick-frowny face
Rabbit food-frowny face
Say he wanna face me
Tell em "Come and skraighten me":
SK-frowny face
AK-frowny face

Some niggas tried to wet me up
Shot up my truck in East Atlanta
Want to set me up because I tricked this nigga in Savannah
They put some money on my head, I had to move to Alabama
Started poppin' with my cousin, mixing 'caine with Arm & Hammer
Somebody blooded my face badly my last visit to the slammer
But they put me in that hole because I beat him like a hammer
The shooter shot my nigga Juice a couple times over by Gresham
Wish I was there just to help him
He pushed on, so I respect him
Before the fortune and the fame
Deep in the game, me and my gang
Behind my rights to getting my record
They tried to murk me for my chain
Two tear drops under my eye because I wish some days I could cry
But to lose my self-respect
My nigga, I would rather die. Gucci!

Homie just texted me
Say my nigga flexed him
Dummy brick-frowny face
Rabbit food-frowny face
Say he wanna face me
Tell em "Come and skraighten me":
SK-frowny face
AK-frowny face

My former label didn't trick me
They just did what was expected
I was self-sufficient before I went independent selling records
I know they're kick theyself in the ass
I'm playing chess, they playing checkers
And they know as well as I, I eat they whole roster for breakfast
I'm a boldercrest professor, you should sign up this semester
That made me laugh cause I'm the king
I cut your head off like the jester
I'm standing tall as Manute Bol and y'all niggas shorter then Buster
I'm the dopeman, y'all the workers, so I feed y'all with the extras
Like Drake, Trey Songz and Wayne I don't know if I want successful
Successfully keeping my cool in situations highly stressful
I'm Gucci, all about the zeros, comma, number and the decimal
So if you looking for a visit to the morgue then I can help you

Homie just texted me
Say my nigga flexed him
Dummy brick-frowny face
Rabbit food-frowny face
Say he wanna face me
Tell em "Come and skraighten me":
SK-frowny face
AK-frowny face

Sitting here on the corner pumping crack and marijuana
You can try me if you wanna, but I promise you'll be a goner
My rep just won't let you do that. I tote two straps, thought you knew that
If you come between my crew's stacks (Bricksquad!), I'll lay you flat like a doormat. Gucci!

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Watch Cost A Bentley"
(feat. Bun B and Rocko)



Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

[Gucci Mane:]
I'm the man, goddamn I'm the man
Future price so high you need a layaway plan
Your girlfriend made me call you and said stay away man
She easy as a free throw so you fade away fast
My ring cost bout' a brick, my watch cost bout' a Benz
Your main chick on my dick, she let me smash her friends
My earrings are so cold, they look like they on fire
You think your stones are colder, I think that you a liar
I hold court in the street, I'm the judge so bring my jewelry
And ain't no one gon' take it so no need to get insurance
My chain cost bout' a Bentley and my trunk cost bout' a Phantom
I'm the King of East Atlanta and I'm shining like a lemon

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

[Bun B:]
You know my time is my money, my money is my time
And I ain't wasting either, so have it on your mind
I shine like a diamond with the cuts of a princess
Ya bitch call me daddy when I fuck her like its incest
Oooo how [?], why you standing close to her
You should be like me and let her go like just you supposed to bruh
Put her on a poster, a flyer and a bottle
[?] in a minute while you high-steppin your prada
I'm all about a dollar if you with me gon' n' holla'
She's a spitter I ain't with' her, you gotta roll or swalla'
Or we can't talk money, we can't chop green
Or convo' about the cabbage if you know what I mean

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

[Rocko:]
Watch me kick it on these suckers like judo
Motley swag's on jones, catch me off in Pluto
All hoes still gon' ice this track, the new hoes
Still the same won't catch me in this thing unless it's two doors
Bitch got on my old dough now I got new dough
Still spending 1991 and '92 dough
Hoes like [?] we the coldest niggas' you know
Everybody have [?]
All the while porque I'm getting cake
How bout' you though?
Favorite food chicken still heavy eating noodles [?] and butter
Gucci, Bun, and Rocko, need I say more
We the vic-tors, kiss my ring whore

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

And I wanna I really want her I got to have her

I wanna her I really want her I think I want her

Ya'll ball when ya'll can but I stunt when I wanna
Your girlfriend wanna fuck me I think were gonna
Marijuana got my beamer foggy as a sauna
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare bitch I'm such a prima donna
I'm East Atlanta shawty but I hang where I wanna
Got a plug in Arizona but used to slang on the corner
Gotta chocolate nerdy lookin chick a ryder like wynona
Told her text my celly plenty when she come from california
You are not the owner of that car that is a loaner, I got money stacks as tall as you cause that's just my persona
I got half a million on my neck come try me if you wanna
Keep a shooter with a chopper turn you to a organ donor

I wanna her I really want her I think I want her
Your girl friend is left with me yeah she's a goner
And I wanna I really want her I got to have her
Now I gotta yeah Gucci gotta I'm bout to smash her

I wanna her I really want her I think I want her
Your girl friend is left with me yeah she's a goner
And I wanna I really want her I got to have her
Now I gotta yeah Gucci gotta I'm bout to smash her

My flow so schizophrenic that I think I need a straightjacket
Straight drop dope flow put me in a crack baggie
Old school like a 1960 cadillac Real well known in every hood that's why these nigga's swagga jackin'
Not in my league nowhere close to my tax bracket
Brick squad charm bout the same size of a tennis racket
Thirty round tone in my jeans got my pants saggin
Let yo girlfriend give me becky now the bitch braggin, rims to the white chain to watch hat to the shoes matchin', since I'm Gucci Mane might as well buy her some new glasses, everybody still Lookin at me when my vette passing, brick squad ceo I guarentee the check cashes

I wanna her I really want her I think I want her
Your girl friend is left with me yeah she's a goner
And I wanna I really want her I got to have her
Now I gotta yeah Gucci gotta I'm bout to smash her

I wanna her I really want her I think I want her
Your girl friend is left with me yeah she's a goner
And I wanna I really want her I got to have her
Now I gotta yeah Gucci gotta I'm bout to smash her

Six stoves in my house and everybody cooking
Ferrari pass by damn everybody looking
A couple million dollars and I'm still straight crooked
You might had the game on hold but I took it
I'm hoppin out the drop lambo like a kangaroo
Gucci brick squad ceo but tell me who the fuck is you
Like simon says yo' big sister do what I tell her to
I tape bricks underneath her tits and then I send her through
Milatary rifles you would think I was a ex-marine
Sk, street sweeper, mac 90 or m16
No I'm not a fighter or a lover I am just a shooter, so if you disrespect my squad I'mma have to shoot ya'

I wanna her I really want her I think I want her
Your girl friend is left with me yeah she's a goner
And I wanna I really want her I got to have her
Now I gotta yeah Gucci gotta I'm bout to smash her

I wanna her I really want her I think I want her
Your girl friend is left with me yeah she's a goner
And I wanna I really want her I got to have her

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Gucci Speaks"



Okay, okay
Public service announcement
We're gonna have a Bricksquad survey
I am going to come with the question
First question!
Jay-Z is the greatest rapper alive?
Survey says...
That's a lie
Gucci Mane is not the hottest rapper in Atlanta?
Survey says...
That's a lie
Someone, somewhere, in someplace
Ran Gucci from a store, block or club?
That is also a lie and you are not telling the truth
Moving on, moving on...
It's the Burrprint 3, staring me!
Gucci Mane that's the leading actor!
Supported by my whole cast, Bricksquad!
Okay, a lot of you niggas are broke
Putting pennies together to buy a quarter
And I feel sorry for you

In my red Ferrari sittin on spinaz, tinited windows
Blinkin like a blinker on the seats of my intiial
Probly seekin u can see me with deez Puerto Ricans
In bikini it look like ima cheatin cause I'm trick or treatin
Sittin on spinneys in my Lamborghini while you dreamers guenie

Fifty thousand dollars all in the air and shit
Brick Squad, dope boi, and the money man
Gucci!

I'm a so Icey veteran so you can't say beginners luck
All my boys tote choppaz so your best bet robbin' armored trucks
Georgia boys don't give a fuck, we'll jack you then we'll tie you up
50-50 chance that we'll trick you if you shop with us
Boulder crest so dirty dirty, zone six boys tote thirty thirties
Glock 9 under Falcon jerseys make you need some plastic surgery
Bandana under my eye, hat so low can't see my face
And if you got them cake to bake then Gucc might do a home invasion
Hi my name is Gucci Gucci meet my homeboy Mackie Slug
Sawed-off AR pulled out shorty you know I got extra slugs
Black T still on when I mob, black lugz still on when I walk
Black pistol 23 my nigga he'll think that's my second job

I walk around the city like, it don't matter
The earth my turf nobody tries me cause they know better
So save the chit chatta I'm too deep you boys shallow
I run 4 deep me and myself and I and plus my shadow
Shadow, my shadow, hold me down for whateva
Even if I tried my best I couldn't run from my shadow
So no matter, how wealthy that I get he's not jealous
So when I have no one to talk to, I talk to my shadow!

Yeah I'm thorough, under my polo, I'm out on promo
Got these tear drops, under my izzeye, don't make it one more
And I had kilos, one for like 2-0, that was 0-4
I had drizzo, you bad da smizzo, but keep it low though
Don't tell the po-po, I'm friend with fizzo, cause that's a no-no
Smokin' guido, me and my vatos, but you's a bozo
I'm passin' low yo, down to La Plizzo, this shit like Wayco
I got candy paint on my '74, your shit from Maaco
And off the tizzop, connect the dizzots, I'm building legos
Ran the tizan just like them waffles, I call them eggos
I got hundreds, all in my pocket, a stupid bank roll
If ya try me, coroner gon' wrap you, up like an egg roll

I walk around the city like, it don't matter
The earth my turf nobody tries me cause they know better
So save the chit chatta I'm too deep you boys shallow
I run 4 deep me and myself and I and plus my shadow
Shadow, my shadow, hold me down for whateva
Even if I tried my best I couldn't run from my shadow
So no matter, how wealthy that I get he's not jealous
So when I have no one to talk to, I talk to my shadow!

Bricks, all white bricks
Corner-boy I probably sold more rocks than a rock pit
Tryin' to fill my shoes is like an armless man with chops sticks
Got a dark brown soft top bentley chocolate
I'm so mach 6, homeboy you so not shit
Playin' free can't come touch me cause you're not it
I'm on fire steaming hot, I can boil grits
Jet-Li with the shoes, Gucci rockin' new kicks
ATLiens baby girl let's have a moon day
Got 8 bedrooms I'm dying for a roommate
I was home schooled, I didn't have a schoolmate
Psych! I went to trap school 60K in 12th grade
I'm a millionaire but self-made wealth craze
Like a junkie cravin' bricks so I'm in kitchens all day
I'm a millionaire but self-made wealth craze
Like a junkie cravin' bricks so I'm in kitchens all day
Skrrrr!

I walk around the city like, it don't matter
The earth my turf nobody tries me cause they know better
So save the chit chatta I'm too deep you boys shallow
I run 4 deep me and myself and I and plus my shadow
Shadow, my shadow, hold me down for whateva
Even if I tried my best I couldn't run from my shadow
So no matter, how wealthy that I get he's not jealous
So when I have no one to talk to, I talk to my shadow!

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Excuse Me"
(feat. MPA Wicced & MPA Duke)



[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci so flossy, all my broads are bossy
Head 'till I'm nauseous, they keep me exhausted
Niggas wanna get it, Gucci went and bought it
My flow has been frostbit, haters wish I lost it
Traded like a foster, ever since a youngster
My lines has been bonkers, I deserve an encore
I heard that she dumped ya, chose me, then I dumped her
Stanky like a dumpster, funky as an oyster
Used to be an Oiler, I think he divorced her
He say he adored her, but he couldn't afford her
I don't have to bore her, financially support her
He do all that lame stuff, I just keep it gangsta

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Please pardon me, please pardon me
I'm sorry I'm so spark-a-ly
I don't say this normally but please excuse my ornaments
Excuse me, excuse me
Please let me floss my jewel-a-ry
Gucci Mane ain't iced out how high you must be kiddin' me
[2x]

[Verse 2:]
I pull up in a Zonda, he pulls up in Honda
Thang short as a garden snake but mine's an anaconda
Wrist like the Artic, my neck is like the jungle
Wardrobe full of animals, my closet's like the Congo
Motor is a monster, trunk is a gorilla
Ask me where my top is at I left it with the dealer
Ballin' in the VIP ther standin' in the line
My watch so stupid icy I can't even tell the time
My necklace full of diamonds, his piece gave him a rash
He bought it from the Texaco cause he didn't save his cash
Tryna be like Gucci Mane but he don't have a swag
Needs to take his jewelry off and throw it in the trash

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'm in the bank making depo's, while y'all be gettin' repo'ed
I'm zero, zero, zero, comma, zero after zero
My jewelry game sick, I think my jeweler needs chemo
Wonder Woman bracelet on but I'm no superhero
Cockiest, I'm rockin' this cause ain't nobody hot as this
So hot as hot lava get and I'm not with that modest shit
Poppin' Cris', think that I need Alcohol Anonymous
.45 in the club, I could kill a hippopotamus
Office chick, college chick, I got game for any chick
I hang out with stars, you would think I'm an astrologist
They should pay me back for all this fuckin' game they borrowin'
Thirty grand a feature and I don't got time for bargainin'

[Hook]

(feat. Kandi and Sean Ceasar)



I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
Yes I wonder what she sees me

I said I wonder what she sees me
I wonder what she sees me
I wonder what she sees me
Yes I wonder what she sees me
I got pistols all around da house
Drug dealer's in my living room
Pounds stash every where
You know that I'm trappin' boo'
I've been selling dope since high school
Tokin ah pistol everywhere
I swear baby I hold you down
I Dare ah Nigga.Dare ah Nigga.Dare ah Nigga
Double Dare
I guess it's just the G' in me
Do you plan your mama meeting me'
I know your daddy don't agree with me
Your baby brother smoking weed with me'

And I wonder what she see in me
I know she see the G in me
Do you plan your mama meeting me
Forever she will be with me

But I wonder what she see in me
Every time she look at me
The judge he wanna throw the book at me
I guess lil mama love's the crook me
And we will be together hopefully
But I'm not too aggressive forcefully
I woke up she say she's loving me
Tomorrow probably be the worst for me
But I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
There's no place that she rather be
Then right here smokin' weed with me

She's right here sippin' lean with me
We gone off on A molly'
She's the life of all The party
Real boss don't get her started
But I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
Do you have on plan's on leaving me?
Do you think that you'll be breaking me
But there ain't no way that you'll be takin' me
I gotta keep that strap with me

"Candy Lady"



[Nitti:]
Hey, aye Gucci
Yo just so they know we in the motherfuckin' studio nigga
See how we doin' that, that ghetto shit like this, y'all already
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Y'all heard that, I said y'all niggas ready
So icy in the buildin'
Gucci, where you at

[Gucci Mane:]
See she the candy lady I'm the candy Mane
She got 3 blocks on her call her candy cane
Like my Glock 9 I keep her right beside me
First I make her drive then I let her ride me

Brand new Gucci bag with a pocket scale
Plus she bust open the bags with her finger nails
She got carats on her wrist and diamonds on her neck
She in my drop top vet thumbing through the check

She say money make her cum, trapping make her wet
Every time we have sex I try to make her sweat
I keep her with some work and keep her in a skirt
We love blowing kush, stay blowing purp

See she the type of girl that a nigga like
And she'll jump off she'll help a nigga fight
She more than a lover she more like a sister
I buy her a bag she buy me a pistol

It's early in the morning she water whippin'
And what you call that I call it homecookin'
See that's my old lady she drive me crazy
But the homies in hood call her the candy lady

(feat. Brick Squad)



[Gucci Mane:]
Wassup Flocka
Wassup Juice
Joey
Wooh
Frenchie
Man we got so much money we don't know what to do with man
Wipe my ass with a hundred, boogars on my money, blow my nose with the money
It's Gucci, it's the burr, burr, Burrprint 3
Getting kinda cold in here, iced out, drinking a cold soda
Chilling in the AC, hopping out the igloo, in Austria East Atlanta

[OJ Da Juiceman:]
Candy lady daisy, whipping up a baby
It's a street brawl and my baby brought a razor
[?] got my truck rollerskating
Early in the morning like the [?]

Baby girl 100 she don't do no faking
Brought my girl a bag then she brought me back a AR
Baby girl 100 she don't do no faking
Brought my girl a bag then she brought me back a AR

[Wooh Da Kid:]
Now she the kinda girl that a nigga like
Always beat it up so she call me Ike
Candy lady take the niggas out the candy land
She got you spending all your money like a ceiling fan

Glock.45 fully loaded clip
Don't think that she gon' pull it if she let it rip
She say she like my chain she want the same thing
First she got the bird with the pink rings

[Gucci Mane:]
See she the type of girl that a nigga like
And she'll jump off she'll help a nigga fight
She more than a lover she more like a sister
I buy her a bag she buy me a pistol

It's early in the morning she water whippin'
And what you call that I call it homecookin'
See that's my old lady she drive me crazy
But the homies in hood call her the candy lady

[Waka Flocka Flame:]
Busting up in this bitch, Flocka need a bad bitch
One night stand baby we can have a maverick
Green chain cabbage, lil' shawty not your average
Light, fake, cute, oh my God

Jump in my car I can make you a star
My swag to the roof, Waka Flame be the truth
Got goons that's gon' shoot, tag your man in body bag
All that flirting can a nigga stab that

She say she digging me, she say she feeling me
I'm so fucking hot I burned her to the 3rd degree
He so industry, I'm so fucking hood
Blowing purple tree and it taste so fucking good

[Gucci Mane:]
See she the type of girl that a nigga like
And she'll jump off she'll help a nigga fight
She more than a lover she more like a sister
I buy her a bag she buy me a pistol

It's early in the morning she water whippin'
And what you call that I call it homecookin'
See that's my old lady she drive me crazy
But the homies in hood call her the candy lady

[Frenchie:]
Baby girl my sister, better off my best friend
Cause if I hop up on a nigga bet she jumping in
Fuck a nickel bag. kilo she shifting in
I ask her for 5 pounds but she bring me 10

That's why I follow her she don't want tilapia
Just give her a cheeseburger and promise not to lie to her
[?] in the South before I got knocked
She'll get money from all of my side bitchs to bail a nigga out

That's why I call her my main squeeze, fittna drop with that cool breeze
When I see her I freeze I like to watch her like HD
Yeah that's my baby no Beyonce and Jay-Z
Cause she walk up on you and rock-a-bye baby

[Gucci Mane:]
See she the type of girl that a nigga like
And she'll jump off she'll help a nigga fight
She more than a lover she more like a sister
I buy her a bag she buy me a pistol

It's early in the morning she water whippin'
And what you call that I call it homecookin'
See that's my old lady she drive me crazy

"No No No"



Vacation for a week
We sexin on the beach
And I ain't taking bout the drink
Open doors fo her when I take her out to eat
Um rollin up a suite while she massage a nigga feet
Lil shawty so fine
I gotta sippin wine
I tell her I don't cheat but she be knowing a nigga lyin
Her friends can't stand me
Dey don't understand me
While dey hoe hoppin I gotta shoppin in miami
Everythings g her fi bought a jeep
A bag a coupla grands and they compliments for me
See I can be the king and she can be my queen
And we can be a team
And fulfill each other dreams
I love the way she talk
Love the way she walk
Um always on her mind and she always on my thoughts
I got her at the house
We blowin on an ounce
Um cooking dinner for her tonight we ain't going out

I meet alot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes but some I say no
I be like no no no you can go go go
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

I meet alot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes but some I say no
I be like no no no you can go go go
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

No wonder bra

Nice job I wearing my star
So um bringing my entruenge
Put it in the air
If u down with gucci gucci
Tell yo boy on to lil flap
Girl so fine just look at her and stare
Millions worth of ice on
No need to compare your jewler is a loser
I think I mite need a kooler
R change it with a ruler
Eat breakfast go to sizzly
Wake up eat lunch in itlay
Buy you all types of ice ornaments
The trap boys do that normally
Um like no no no if you ain't a bad bitch you can go go go

I meet alot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes but some I say no
I be like no no no you can go go go
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

I meet alot of hoes

Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

Over seas we holding hands
Gucci louie parada

I spoil her like my daughter
So she love me like her father
Cruising the atlantic

Spaghetti strap dressshe ain't wearing panies

Sex her on the couch
Freak her on the sink
I think tomorrow I mite go buy her a mink

Sex her on the couch
Freak her on the sink
I think tomorrow I mite go buy her a mink

Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"My Chain"
(feat. Black Magic)



[Gucci Mane:]
My chain!
My chain, my chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain?

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

I came to the club, just to floss my chain mayne
Catch another charge and I'm goin to the chain gang
... Oh I think I'm icy
Sold a hundred thou' eatin bologna [?] white streak
... Don't you see how bright it is?
City girls and country girls be tellin me how tight it is
... These girls they be choosy
Diamonds be so sparkly they thank my chain was movin
... My chain is off the chain
Stacked up me some money, budget off and bought a chain
... Check the way my chain hang
Gucci I don't gangbang, all I do is chain swang

Gucci you be shinin, Gucci you be shining man
Go on turn me on homes tell me who your diamond man
... My girlfriend actin lame
She say I'm actin different just because I got this chain
... Haters get your hater on
When they see them yellow stones, holla at'cha later on
My chain hang to my shoestrang
Like my watch and ring, but I know you love my chain
My chain hang to my ding-a-ling
I do my thug thang when I'm in the club mayne
When you heard "So Icy," you thought of Gucci Mane
I got that stupid money so I bought a stupid chain

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

[Black Magic:]
Yeah, my first chain I had to rob for it
Jesus piece, yellow diamonds sittin all in it
I'm on some Slick Rick shit, 2006 Mr. T
Diamonds so bright ain't no way you can't see the G
Look I don't dance, I just lean with it
Yeah my piece sick, every robber tryin to leave with it
I got that New York fitted on, full suit dickie on
Gucci link chain, blue stones in a nigga charm
Now watch me do it, do it with no hands
Drop twenty grand on that bezel and that band
Cause I'm the man, I-I-I'm the man
Got no wife, but my chain got my girlfriend

[Gucci Mane:]
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Classical (Intro)"



Ahhhhh gucci, gu u u cci 
Ahhhhh gucci, gucci ahh 
Nothings goin to stop my reign ahh ahh [2x]

[Gucci Mane:]
Part of my pain is run through problems 
Stoppable I jump over obstacles 
Stop my grind like stop sunshine
So impropable probable mission impossible 
I said it two times nigga, nigga stop lying 
Bullshit you sellin now I'm just not buying 
Flow so nice but the kid's not kind 
Swear its sicker than a new flu they got called swine
Standing on point like a unicorn
Strapped with a unibomb
Everdays a workday but dont wear uniform
Gucci mane a dubadun
Trouble like a capricorn
Trapper month goin on a money makin marathon
U the jocker I be robin
And the riddle is the batmans throne
Try not to fuck my money up and rap career like pacman jones
Thumb print me, finger print me
But can we agree to disagree
Im from east atlanta 6 where the boys dump bricks
But we dont bump the blueprint 3
Wanna box me jus like max speed
But you cant fuck me like resh p
Like ali ima float like a butterfly sting like a bee cuz its big gucci, gucci

Ahhhhh gucci, gu u u cci 
Ahhhhh gucci, gucci ahh 
Nothings goin to stop my reign ahh ahh [2x]

Streets de-railed me
But god didnt fail me
Oppurtunity knocked but it just emailed me
D.A nailed me, watch them jail me
Take it like a champ while the whole world mail me
Young dont like me, jay outselles me
Nothing in the world kanye couldnt tell me
You can beat anyone but gucci
Jaw so hard I can hardly do me
Cuz whatever that I heard use to let that 
Bet if you had the chance to you'd mute me
Convicted felon my lil friends jailin
My stash here you go and my bones done swellin
Crazy so I need prozac really
My home kept skep n my folks so eary
So hardworkin that my bones still reary
Fall in the club then the hoes start cheerin
So hear me, hear me, I know yall hear me
I dont like life to much not really
High like britney, stoned like jimmy
Got a second chance like vick in philly
This aint snap music, this is trap music
New boyz in cali yea they got a jerk movement
Bricksquad niggaz we rep the block
Gucci mane I work forks n pots

Ahhhhh gucci, gu u u cci 
Ahhhhh gucci, gucci ahh 
Nothings goin to stop my reign ahh ahh [2x]

Ahhhhh gucci, gu u u cci 
Ahhhhh gucci, gucci ahh 
Nothings goin to stop my reign ahh ahh [2x]

Back in the trap!
Heavy, real heavy, its so heavy, heavy, real heavy
Gucci, gucci, gucci, gucci,

Heavy, real heavy, it feels heavy,
Somebody help me,
My neck hurt, my chain heavy,
Heavy, door heavy, flow heavy,
Gucci bag full of cash, its so heavy,
Listen, I cant land it, I go get it,
My ego gettin too big, its too heavy,
My head gettin too big, its so heavy,
Somebody help me, took all this cash its too heavy.

My bitch say everytime she look up im bout to do a cook up ,
I told he if she know like I know she will shut the fuck up,
Introduce color the soda and I said yall need to hook up,
I pimp that white girl like a mother fuckin hooker,
I took 300 out my stash and I went and bought a phantom,
I need some toilet paper, im the shit in east atlanta,
On a 90 day tour so my niggas really miss me,
I couldnt kick it with them so I took my whole hood with me,
And I just got out of jail, ya they tried to michael vick me,
I gave my lawyer half a mill and told him come and get me,
Im not wit g-unit but this drum here cost me 50,
This chain another 50 thats a hundred on you snitches

Heavy, real heavy, it feels heavy,
Somebody help me,
My neck hurt, my chain heavy,
Heavy, door heavy, flow heavy,
Gucci bag full of cash, its so heavy,
Listen, I cant land it, I go get it,
My ego gettin too big, its too heavy,
My head gettin too big, its so heavy,
Somebody help me, took all this cash its too heavy.

Im so confused, dont have a clue, man, what to do.
Should I rob him, or should I serve him, you know the rules,
I keep miami heat, got more scrap then a gun show,
Run up on the kid, I have you moarning like alonzo,
Try me if you want to, I send my shooters pronto,
I know u die, but hell I dont know where you gotta go,
Run up on me wrong, try your luck, cause I dont think so,
This four four that I told will leave a whole size of a pot hole.
Yeah I got amigo, but they dont bring me tacco,
Only bring me kilos, but keep that on the d lo.
Im getting my tip fade cut, bouldercrest, and flat show,
Wish a nigga would run up on me like im brisco.

Heavy, real heavy, it feels heavy,
Somebody help me,
My neck hurt, my chain heavy,
Heavy, door heavy, flow heavy,
Gucci bag full of cash, its so heavy,
Listen, I cant land it, I go get it,
My ego gettin too big, its too heavy,
My head gettin too big, its so heavy,
Somebody help me, took all this cash its too heavy.

Uh well I think I need a hundred pack, and I aint even finished,
Im im in this deuplex in the 6, I only use the kitchen,
Im the same with my grinder post, yeah I got big bags of smoke,
You fuck niggas dont call my phone unless you wanna buy some dro,
I got birds like atlanta zoo, bitch you a fool,
I got goons like a scary movie, yeah that is true,
And I change cars like a rich white girl change shoes,
Gotta go, go get get them the money, little cuz wanna duce,
And I was holdin under 32, 2002 you know its true,
Bought em a sun valley jacob, me and juice, you know the crue.
I got money stacks credential, now still aint spent old bred,
If you wanna gladly pour some change on your own head.

Heavy, real heavy, it feels heavy,
Somebody help me,
My neck hurt, my chain heavy,
Heavy, door heavy, flow heavy,
Gucci bag full of cash, its so heavy,
Listen, I cant land it, I go get it,
My ego gettin too big, its too heavy,
My head gettin too big, its so heavy,
Somebody help me, took all this cash its too heavy.

And if you wanna fight,
Come on you can fight my guns
Weezy man, young money

Yellow lambs, Yellow MP's
Yellow watch, Yellow charm ring, chain
Yellow livin room set, Lemonade gucci shoes for my girl
GUCCI

[Verse 1]
My phantom sittin on sixes, no 20's in my gun
Your cutlass motor knockin, because it is a lemon
I like dem Georgia-peaches, but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches, im not fuckin with em
Im truly stupid paid thats just how I feel today,
Im movin slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
Im standing in the shade and im sellin lemonade
600 a pint da going rate off in the "A"
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in ur face (BURR)
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday (BURR)
Im pimpin wearin linon, thats just how im chillon
Im smokin grits and sellin chickens, corvette painted lemons
GUCCI!!!

[Chorus:]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Livin out of shame with my feet up
Livin out of shame with my feet up
Lemon Pepper wangs and the freeze cup
Lemon Pepper wangs and the freeze cup
Lemons on my face watch em freeze up
Lemons on my face watch em freeze up

[Verse 2]
I got lemonade and lemon teeth
Lemons watch me mix the shit
Lemonade complexion, east-australian girl be killin me
She say i be killin her, i say i be feelin it

Yellow boat parked at the dock,Yellowbone gon' make it drop

She just had a long day 
Know i got that long cake

And the dance floor aint nothing without ya girl

No need ta introduce myself, I let my money do the Greeting 
So conceited, that if she ain't worth talking to then Im not speakin

And my sex game gladiator tell me are you entertained 
Im an entertainer Baby but my name aint Cedric 
I got cheddar and etcetera 
So stop the rhetoric 
But enough about me baby, sweetie tell bout ya self 
Are you married or divorced, dont gotta tell me thats your choice 
I like ya voice I like ya swagg 
So let nature take its course, Maybe in the Future 
Gorgeous I can buy ya ass a Porche

Everytime with you is fun 
In Dubai, London, Paris baby, we can watch the sun 
Set and rise 
Or just lay back on the beach and watch the sky 
(Gucci)

She's been sent to me, lent to me

While Zay control the symphony 
No twistin it she swichin it but she not all promiscuous 
Its obvious she's marvelous and wants to be a part of this 
I give her 1,000 percent but this that 50, 50 shit 
Im wealthy and Im Healthy so cut off that boy you kickin wit 
Give her 1,000 percent but this that 50, 50 shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Dinner date, please dont be late

Sex so hot and passionate 
It'll make her hyperventilate 
Yea Ima bachelor but Im workin my masters 
And no im not a doctor but my money 
Go way past one, shes hotter than my last one 
Sexy like my last chick im checkin out her assets 
Her ex-boyfriend is past tense 
I talk to her, I listen to her. text her then she text me 
I rap to her she walks to me and damn her walk is sexy 
Our last nite was so good I think about her next day 
More but then four ashtrays she told me boy you crazy 
Burnin all my candles and lighting all my incense 
Im givin her my imprint cause damn I like her accent

And if I choose first she choose me then she special 
Long walks all night dawg I can help her bless her

Stack up loud pack make her catch a contact 
Dumb sets long stacks I can make her come back

"Sex In Crazy Places"
(feat. Bobby Valentino, Nicki Minaj, Trina)



[Chorus (Bobby Valentino):]
I wanna do you at cho momma house,on the couch,
Do you in the bathroom or the air-o-plane.
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi,
Cause I can't get enough of that thing
Say we can do it anywhere
(Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere
(Crazy)
We can do it anywhere
Crazy places,
I wanna freak you anywhere
(Crazy)

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo lets do it up in Disney in the magic kingdom
You can tug on my gissupes in my badgly mischka
I'm a b b b, I'm a bag of fun
I'm a pro with them balls like And 1
Now lets go, Mexico? thats where we next to go
Do it like his mama, make him eat his vegatables
Call me a stage mom, boy you best a blow
Or you can even call me wanda, cuz I'm red to go
You know I'm spoiled lil daddy, stomps the floor
We can do it in 5th ave in the department store
We can do it in tokyo we do it in taiwan
All my harajuku girls say I am they icon

[Chorus (Bobby Valentino)]

[Gucci Mane:]
Don't compare me to your ex mane,
baby he a local joker,
I'll take you to six flags
& drill you on the roller coaster
call your girlfriends over we can have a sleepover
buy yo ass a jeep, so I can fuck you in the range rover
Pictures of her nude, On a crusie We gone make the news,
sex scrait, sex tape, ready for a youtube
Damn it turn me on, when we do it in your mama home
Father long gone but gucci can be your daddy baby
I can fly you anywhere, We can sex and crazy places,
Airport,Train station, going up the escalator,
At the dome, on the 50, I'm gon throw it, you the center
When you hike it, I'm a spike it,
Girl dont act like u dont like it.

[Chorus (Bobby Valentino)]

[Trina:]
How bad you wanna do me, on a scale of 1 to 10
You like the way I bend now you askin where I been,
If I'm doing him, Now you starting that again,
I dont want to sex your friend, He dont got enough to lend,
plus he was doing Lynn, and she aint nothing like amazing
Her stuff run deep, and he don't have a occupation
I'm known across the nation, Trina's that chick
Bow leg, red bone, long hair, real thick
do me at my mama house, nah I don't think so
I go too much class but you can try to San Pedro
I need the biggest mansion, ocean back yard
with the newest Maybach, and inside a black card

[Chorus (Bobby Valentino)]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"The Movie"



Im jumpin out my coupe wit da missin roof and I'm so fuckin high I need a parachute.
"Gucci Mane, do you remember me from last month?"
"Girl, I can't remember nothin but my last blunt"
Bling blau diamond necklaces for every chain.
Bitch I'm Gucci so I put rims on bout everythang.
I used to care about money now these days I don't so if I like her enough I'll buy her everythang she want.
I got that 357 so don't try your luck.
Bullets have yo body hot you'll need a fire truck.
So re-up with us, got white girl yeah that anime.
Today I'm shittin on rappers so I call em Jazze Pha. 

I'm not a boy so I can not be your boyfriend but, if you want me to then I can be your Gucci Mane.
And if you're man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can.
Just ask your lady and I bet that shes a Gucci fan.
Bought all my hoes Gucci, most all my clothes Gucci, this ain't no coogi you still can't move me.
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie, gucci mane movie, gucci mane movie. 

Lambo engine in the rear and I'm switchin gears.
Yall suckas can't fuck wit dis young nigga here.
Diamonds on my neck colder than a case of beer.
So when I fall off in the club all the bitches cheer.
In an '06 convertible my top can disappear.
Just bought a house in cali pool parties of the year.
Tip fade stupid ways I don't wear beer.
They say that Gucci stay fresh but dat nigga weird. 
Girl you ridin wit la flare so what you got to fear? 

I'm not a boy so I can not be your boyfriend but, if you want me to then I can be your Gucci Mane.
And if you're man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can.
Just ask your lady and I bet that shes a Gucci fan.
Bought all my hoes Gucci, most all my clothes Gucci, this ain't no coogi you still can't move me.
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie, gucci mane movie, gucci mane movie. 

Jazze Pha, Gucci know they didn't expect this it ain't no secret run up on me you'll regret it.
Im like a ball player focused on my next hit.
And I hit homeruns I don't know how to bunt bitch.
And this that cali kush you need to pass the blunt bitch.
Im Sorry that I cuss you baby girl you're gorgeous.
Psych you're not gorgeous but your ass is enormous.
And if you never call me I'll be rich regardless.
Picture perfect flow this verse is a boy trick.
I got three matches but..... bouldercrest flash show, seen greshem where I started....... 

I'm not a boy so I can not be your boyfriend but, if you want me to then I can be your Gucci Mane.
And if you're man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can.
Just ask your lady and I bet that shes a Gucci fan.
Bought all my hoes Gucci, most all my clothes Gucci, this ain't no coogi you still can't move me.
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie, gucci mane movie, gucci mane movie.

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Volume"
(feat. Wooh da Kid)



Gucci, scoochie,
OK, paper out, paper out

[Hook:]
I'm so motherfucking turned up right now (volume)
Someone please turn Gucci Mane down (volume)
Bricksquad thugged out, we don't give a fuck (volume)
We hit the club, shoot the club, tear the club up (volume)
So you should hit the floor, get low and shut up (volume)
Hit the floor, get low and shut the fuck up (volume)
Yous a bitch, yous a snitch, you a motherfucking scrub (volume)
Yous a bitch, yous a snitch, you a motherfucking scrub (volume)

[Verse 1]
I pulled up in a four door Porsche set tripping
Three young dread head niggas riding with me
I don't think they like me and I don't like 'em neither
But if they move wrong I'll red up they white beater
I do it for the hood, I do it like no equal
I do it for the red, black, yellow, white people
I just bought a kay, just the other day
And I don't play with grown men I don't like to play
I'm so motherfucking turned up right now
Niggas hating on me, I don't give a fuck right now
Well, you niggas keep on trying like the little engine that could
You think you can, you think you could, I think you pussies should

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Call me Gucci flocka flame, I then changed my name
Call me frenchie mane, la flare, gucc the kid -- it's all the same
I be running, gunning, stunting with 100 killers riding
You snitching, bitching, tattle telling scared to stand beside me
I just bought another house just to hold my goons
So icy entertainment boy we just like a platoon
The colors in my chain remind me of a cartoon
I'll murk your boy in March baby find that boy the June
I wish they found him August so that's like tomuch too soon
His face was swoll and puffy about the color of a prune
Bricksquad movement and no you're not a part of it
Me waka and woo juice and frenchie mane started it

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Wooh da Kid:]
Iced out bar, got me balling like the lakers
Homicide around the corner where you in Jamaica
My volume on max, you boys better run
Ima nigga with an attitude holding on the gun
17 niggas I left 16 hit, last nigga hit the corner, got his whole head split
Told you you're a goner, ima leave you dead quick
I'm like asalam-aleikum, left them ... prick
Wooh, the kid thugged out, we don't give a fuck
Let your soul meet the sole of the bottom of my chucks
Black car, black tint with the big tags, stay low to the floor
My midget out bag, my midget out the bag

[Hook]

"Gingerbread Man"
(feat. OJ da Juiceman)



Its money mane, n juice man, n gucci mane, gucci mane, 

[Gucci]
Ima keep droppin versus, 
Hotta den tha hottest summa, 
Eat rappers like jeffrey domer, 
Dope color shanay o conner?, 
Should I name another woman, 
Russian like president obama, 
Wannna buy two extra commas, 
All my shoes are fara gomma? 
Lightning actually hittin thunda, 
Even stevie wonder wonder, 
Why yo girl get home on time so much I had to change my numba, 
Sarcasism, these bitches need to ride em while I pass em, 
I wouldnt even give that bitch a orgasim, 
Miraculisly my niggas stand beside, not in back of me, 
So disrespect my faculty, how dare u have audasity, 
The ??, I cash out automatically, 
I spit these rhymes so radically, spiratically, fatality. 

[Chorus]
I got the green, drank, pills, blow, 
Runnin round the town gettin money I suppose, 

Im the gingerbread man [X4]

I got the green, drank, pills, blow, 
I kant get up, sleep, jus keep knockin on my door, 

Im the gingerbread man [X4]

[OJ da Juiceman]
Gingerbread Man, I got white, I got white, 
Trap house bunkin up all night, take flight, 
Droppin 10 bases? its jumpin that white? 
Trees to that paper so im something like a kite, 
Loud stanky kush and it tellin me to light, 
Extra loud diamonds and its lookin like a light, 
Rollin stay money and my pockets just glide, 
Everday diamonds kuz they dont like to hide, 
Vvs light yea so you block yo eyes, 
Burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie, 
Hit ya color diamonds?? and get ratchet like a fly? 
The brick man, the bread man I dont tell no lies. 

[Chorus]
I got the green, drank, pills, blow, 
Runnin round the town gettin money I suppose, 

Im the gingerbread man [X4]

I got the green, drank, pills, blow, 
I kant get up, sleep, jus keep knockin on my door, 

Im the gingerbread man [X4]

"Wasted"
(feat. Plies)



[Hook:]
Rockstar lifestyle mite don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sippin on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning ain't 10 o'clock drinkin
Party party party let's all get wasted
Shake it for me babygirl do it butt naked
I'm so wasted she so wasted
Tell the bartender send me 20 more cases

[Verse 1:]
Living like Witney geekin like Brittney
Gucci no hippy but he stoned like jimmy
Best pill poppas geeked up crazy
Whole click rolling everyone's wasted
Purple codeine sprite pink don't waste it
Mix up grandma drank & then tast it
Now grandma sippin syrup leanin wasted
Walkin around fuck up twistin her finger
Homegirl slipped up drunk got wasted
Now she backstage and she tryin to get famous
She be up drinkin drinkin gucci mane checkin
Club night damn right gucci mane wasted

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Plies]
I Don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm lookin for a bitch ta suck this almond joy
Say she gotta stop suckin cause her jaw sore
Gotta a bitch on the couch bitch on the floor
My partner just pop another one now he rollin more
Was on three pills now he on four
I don't know why but the remy turn me into a whore
Walk into the club pocket full of big faces
Got the .40 on my waist and is off safety
About 40 goons with me and we all wasted
On remy straight tonight dogg no chasin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Whole Click Faded we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelets we white boy wasted
No shirt fuck it I let her see the tatted
We sloppy drunk disgustin and liquour keep wastin
285 eastside Me and plies wasted
Wasting several big booty brawl chasing
Spring bling 50 thousand white girls shakin
Some dancin naked but everyone wasted
Magic city monday ball player wasted
This is for the other drink dustin buds wasted
12 pack wasted I need more cases
And gucci down at oasis all my diamonds caucasion

[Hook]

"Kush Is My Cologne"
(feat. Bun B, E-40, Devin the Dude)



Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong 
Kush is my cologne, Ku-Kush is my cologne 
[BUN B]
Got a swisher filled up with that one hitter quitter bro 
Bubba for ya troubles on the double itll get ya bro 
Pass me the d's, light it up with ease, in a cirle full of G's,
Smokin on them trees 
Pass me a cigar, and imma buss it down quick 
Pass me the purple, make sure that hoe is round and think 
Break it down, fill it up, roll it up and light it 
And you know it's the bomb, soon as it get ignited 
Pimpin I can't even fight it, its callin me to smoke 
So I fire up another square and take another toke 
I be damn near goin broke 
And my girl say I'm wrong, Shit but 
KUSH IS MY COLOGNE 
Im inhalin it, exhaling it, it makes me more intelligent 
I feel like I'm still mailin it or sellin it, they smellin it 
Kush, purp, strong dro. What I need cologne fo? 
They tried to send me to rehab but I said: 
No No I wont go 
Damn its really loud, spendin like a whole pound 
Kush cologne, haze is her perfume 
Bubba kush for breakfast, with my captain crunch 
I smoke ten blunts before lunch 
No that sounds like that's too much 
Im so high, Im so in the sky, everybody know 
Marijuana is my fragrance, probably smell it on my clothes 
I smoke that bubonic sonic, I've been sippin gin and tonic 
You lil boys is hooked on phonics, Gucci hooked on chronic sonic
[DEVIN THE DUDE]
Kush is my cologne, I got many fragrances 
Shit gets so expensive but I hardly have to pay for shit 
Every puff is like a squirt, smell it all off in my shirt 
Coworkers give me compliments every time I go to work 
What kinda cologne you on? 
Dro is like my aftershave 
Have me feelin and smellin so good yo I don't have to bathe 
But by all means, I must keep my balls clean 
Make sure my dicks legit then I go take care the small things 
And it all seems worth it 
450's kinda steep but I deserve it 
Weed smell so loud that you think you heard that purp

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Worst Enemy"



[Chorus]
I'm my best friend
and I'm my worst enemy
and no one else can hurt me unless I let them
is you feelin me
and misery loves company and I had my share of misery
no mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
First Tupac died then Biggie died
and that greatly impacted me
then history repeated itself through me and I make history
(its Gucci)
so I dont turn around no more
I look at whats in front of me
I'm focused on the future cos yesterday is history

[Verse 1]
A hard head makes a soft ass
guess yo mom didnt teach ya that
pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet ya at
but let me check my schedule
Im free Tuesday 3 weeks from now
you bring your crew I bring my crew
just pick a time and side of town
zone 6 is my stomping ground
but I guess you know that by now
but everywhere you go you hear me
thats why your upset right now
bought a Phantom and a Lamb
but Im in my vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber
bank account are pregnant now
the day they tried to murder me a day I cant forget about
and I dont wish no death on homie
just want him to hear me out
think about the past and all the many things we talked about
think about all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I am not the perfect person
me dont spit the perfect verses
I wouldnt hurt a girl on purpose cos I feel they dont deserve it
I admit my words can hurt
I dissed tiny she didnt deserve it
our song didnt interpret it right and Im sorry for it
T.I. many times encouraged
told me face the game with courage
clay me some great advice and still today I thankful for it
Me Jeezy and T.I. share one thing in common all are poets
role model to young people tho at times man we still ignore it
and yall gon owe respect to me and I dont like apologies
just diss me till you satisfied
i swear it doesnt bother me
sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets
wont reflect off me but words and insults only show the World how yall respectin me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All my homies aint my homies
hell my friends no longer want me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
things I got I know they want it
things I done they havent done it
tho they say that they my friends
I know that these n-ggas opponent
we can joke and laugh and party
but I know their smiles are phoney
but I still pray that the Lord give em all the things they wanted
all the money in the World cant get the joy Im felling homie
like the third date with a woman like you and not for your money
you can help someone and love someone but still they turn and burn you
so i warn you in advance watch out cos so called friends will con you
Think MJG said it best when will I ever know? who my friends through thick and thin cos so called friends will turn to foes.
through thick and thin cos so called friends will turn to foes.

[Chorus]

Burrr
It's young Burrr

It's still Gucci...
And we WASTED

[Chorus:]
Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (Wasted)
Livin life high everyday, clique wasted (Wasted)
Sippin on purple stuff, rollin up stanky (Wasted)
Wake up in the morning 10 o'clock drankin (Wasted)
Party party party let's all get wasted (Wasted)
Shake it for me baby girl do it butt naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender send me 20 more cases

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My alias is Gucci Mane, my name is Radric Davis (who)
If you take the time to step infront of my shine, that time is wasted (wow)
See I don't got time to waste, 'less I waste it with the crew
Yo girl drunk, she dropped it low and waste Cris all over my shoes (well damn)
Back to the bass, (back to, back to, back to)
Man I'm racist (go) tho I'm not my ranch caucasion
Plus my goons smoke like jamacains (burrr)
You hot, but hatin on me
You sleepy, Gucci ain't hot? Homeboi you trippin
Still consider coke in my car so yo kinfolks gon keep drippin
I'm movin that 'caine like I'm moving my Range
Don't soil my name, just step up yo game
I'm a leave this game same way that I came
Can't waste my breath, no need to explain
Baby girl I wasted it, on my bracelet (burrr)
Didn't wanna walk though we maded it
This Wasted Remix with Baby, Wayne and 'Kiss and I cremated it
(GUCCI)

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rockstar lifestyle might not make it
President got him in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it said right now
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panetela dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti bat black, where they do that at?
South beach, Miami hoe
I'm probably with Tammy To (Tammy Torres)
My life is a video, and the women want that cameo
I just want them pantyhose and I'm higher than geranimo
An I got the tools, tell em boys it can get mechanical

[Chorus:]
Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (Wasted)
Livin life high everyday, clique wasted (Wasted)

Bitches get naked off the stones in the bracelet (ha ha)
Said you got coke, I brought a fiend along to taste it (uh)
Money come fast now, we ain gotta chase it (naw)
Kush got a nigga feelin like he in The Matrix
Hennessey, Patron, Grey Goose, Aces (yeah)
Alcohol, Tobacco, firearm cases (T.I.)
Dufflebag double up, big faces (yes)

Big money, make a pearl handle with 2 clips

Poppin Don P iced out my baby girl
Catch me in the club with my mac and my strap on
Bitches high rollin, white doves, gettin they freak on
Get my clap on, get my money on
Shinin all the time, now watch me bring it home

Mo money than I've seen, no ceilings bitch

[Chorus:]

(feat. Ludacris)



[Verse 1]
I'm obnoxious
I'm flowing crazy, I need to stop this
don't knock this
you nigga's lazy yall need to watch this
Preposterous
if you can fathem how you can block this
my phantom was seen on candler
you ride the transit
no options you niggas can't act like yall forgot this I'm tired 
but switch ya flow up it's so monotonous it's my metropolis 
I'll drop a 12 on ya so colossus! 
My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip 
I'm the nigga upload your twitter bitch I'm the topic 
profess it but 
gucci didn't graduate from college 
your girlfriend say's my ear rings are erotic 
my lambo doors open upward they're robotic it's gucci

[Chorus:]
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
birds in the living room it's like atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks crocs and gators for my shoes
monkey nigga's in my hood I'm living in the zoo
birds in the living room and the kitchen too
im a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too 
But my gun can stop an elephant just like atlanta zoo (gucci)

[Verse 2:]
Drop beam 
Off set things color ice cream 
white dreams 
she can fuck me that's a pipe dream 
S-O poppin x-pills so exciting 
my ex chick n ex homeboy uninvited cases of ace of spade bitch getcha wasted 
the waitress I made her reloaded like the matrix 
I lean laid with a bad bitch black n asian
On 20 headed to buckhead I'm racing baby
but take that fake jewelery off that shit is fugasey
You think that you're hotter than the kid youre mistaken 
real n you nigga's really really good at faken 
So trill I'ma keep it real I'm back to the basics

[Chorus:]
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
birds in the living room it's like atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks crocs and gators for my shoes
monkey niggas in my hood I'm living in the zoo
birds in the living room and the kitchen too
im a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too 
But my gun can stop an elephant just like atlanta zoo (gucci)

[Ludacris:]
Heads up
my partner stashin bricks up on his roof top
Whole key, half a key, quarter key 
gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin juke box
Pop-pop hear the glock cock 
And I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D 
semi automatic that I keep up in the attic in shank that shape like tennessee (ugh!)
I cut ya
I cut ya til the white meat 
And my partner pushin more crack than a bike seat 
I smoke the best I get my dro from california
get high n go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma
but these nigga'z aint got no heart not even if they had a doner 
I roam the streets so who the fuck is YOU
southside collipark king of the jungle my name is ludacris living in atlanta zoo

[Chorus:]
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
birds in the living room it's like atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks crocs and gators for my shoes
monkey nigga's in my hood I'm living in the zoo
birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too 
But my gun can stop an elephant just like atlanta zoo (gucci)

"Boy From The Block"



I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

I pull up in that Spyder, strapped up like McGyver
Should have brought my Phantom, na, but I'm mad at my driver
Pull up in that Spyder, strapped up like McGyver
Should have brought my Phantom, na, but I'm mad at my

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

I pull up in that Spyder, strapped up like McGyver
Should have brought my Phantom, na, but I'm mad at my driver
He so fuckin' turned up, ridin' on auto pilot, smokin' kush and smilin'
He drinkin' while he drivin'

Gucci please excuse me, hu, all my goons got jewelry on 'em
All my niggas booked up, paper they get it on their own
I don't think you know me, homie, I suggest you leave me alone
I got so much jewelry on, that I think I need a clone

I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light
Shinin' like a flash light, I might damage ya eye sight
Gucci got that real ice, don't it look real nice
I don't want your girlfriend, homie but my bitch might

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

Shops at the Chanel shop, that's how she shop
500 for the flip flops 'cause they ain't Reebok
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots
Gotta spot in the hood, no sofa just pot

I'm hot, so hot stand next, get shocked
I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock
If you talkin' to me, all the questions that I wanna know
If she ain't got no money, know you gotta have some dough

Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder
You a bitch, one more bitch, I only fuck with starters
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds
A whole bag full of kush, I been buckin' since a youngin'
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin'
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion

In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'
My pocket do the conversation, make all the decisions
I only fuck with bad bitches 'cause I'm very picky

He can't buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigid
My charm big as a midget, I give yo' ass the business
So if you got yo' swag right you know that you can get it

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

"Parked Outside"



Imma run out front to see me when you walked out
I'm in the candy old school with the music up loud
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Just wait until you see what I got parked outside

Now my vet is on 'shanties and my dunk is on crutches
The hummers on 8s just to make your bitch thirsty
Outside now is a cutlass on buttons
It got so much pound you girl eardrums busting
A school boy Chevy and the rims are off mustard
A 66 muzzle got it smellin down cuesta
The lam hit morlen plaza needing more bubble
Ridin tinted window cuz my fan base doubled
I dropped the top in the summer bitches in trouble
Before the door slam my 74 burt rubber
Nex light I seen the chick candy red rover
Pulled up let the window down pull over

Imma run out front to see me when you walked out
I'm in the candy old school with the music up loud
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Just wait until you see what I got parked outside

See the whips so big I feel I'm bout to fall down
I gotta quarter pound of kush I'm bout to blow the house down
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside

Now the outsides candy but the insides oustrich
You homeboys hate it but his girlfriends jockin
Red light red stop sign dont stop it
Quarter back dub stop it keep goin
A/C blowin feelin like its' snowin
Now where I'm goin even I'm not knowin
But yo girlfriend is damn sho nosey
She lookin in my car so I left the door open
I'm gettin chosen
Baby girl throat me
1 mile later got baby girl chokin
Whips skinny tires got me slidin like lotion
I'm so high still I'm so focused
I seen a red bone in a earth-toned lotus
I said I'm Gucci Mane la flare she said already knowin
I seen a red bone in a earth-toned lotus
I said I'm Gucci Mane she said already knowin

Imma run out front to see me when you walked out
I'm in the candy old school with the music up loud
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Just wait until you see what I got parked outside

See the whips so big I feel I'm bout to fall down
I gotta quarter pound of kush I'm bout to blow the house down
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what I got parked outside

"Gucci On The Rise"



[Verse 1:]
I am barsick, proceed with caution cause I be flaucin', I didn't do that feature with you cause you not important
Major coorporation, I am the most wanted person?, while you niggas getting extored, I ride by fast put on the gas, don't make me li-zate, these brizacks stashed in my jizeans look likes some thighpads, it's funny, just like a dimad without no eyelash, I have yo car, I fuck with his O's, fuck with my kizad. Run up on me son, you'll run up on the wrong one, keep a shooter with a gun to empty the whole?, my niggas rushing at you like a cornerback blitz, nigga that's what you get for talking at that shit, Gucci.

[Chorus:]
Well, Gucci like to drank, Gucci like to smoke, well Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke, [x3]
Well, Gucci like to drank, Gucci like to smoke, well Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke, well Gucci Mane's a G, tell me something I don't know.

[Verse 2:]
Word to the wise, Gucci Mane's a wise guy, the? shoot you 25 times, my session yesterday recorded 25 lines, haters fuck with other niggas shit but they don't fuck with mine. You a lie, low down, freakin' lie, that is not the truth boy you know I keep it trill and real in and out the booth, on that Goose and Cranberry Juice, droptop that Cranberry Coupe', Gucci is alotta things but fasho' I'm not scared of you, swaggerific, catastrophic, tatted down, them niggas get it, but stop with all of that bullshitin', you know you ain't fucking with me, deeper than just rappin', yo bitch diggin' me, she bought a shovel, yo boyfriends the basement, I'm the roof we on two different levels,

[Chorus:]
Well, Gucci like to drank, Gucci like to smoke, well Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke, [x3]
Well, Gucci like to drank, Gucci like to smoke, well Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke, well Gucci Mane's a G, tell me something I don't know.

Holiday Season!

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Coca Coca"
(feat. Rocko, OJ Da Juiceman, Waka Flocka, Shawty Lo, Yo Gotti & Nicki Minaj)



[Gucci Mane:]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rastas
More ganja then reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me; Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave 10 birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop em at Moreland Plaza
Flow sick like the morning after, try me then yo skull get fractured
Ransom yo lil hansom son, so sad yo that first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter, but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another toughta, if you serve me then get shot up
Ounce, a half, a eighth, a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard got from my father, take no shit got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother

Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Rocko:]
Only one dude and I'mma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay low key and get doe wit my people
Maybe try to find me some blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got love bitch, drop a few pounds
Count a few checks deal them out
Shoot a lil dice, pour a lil out
Sell a lil poweder make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug everything about my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day they said I wouldn't be shit
Tell them fuck niggas "nigga look at me now!"
Mami on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don't make no sense we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club everybody like "wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club I'm stunting on the couch
Balling like a balla me and Gucci ballin' out
Shawty got it for the low who said it was a drought?
Swag run so hard man these hoes like "Ow"
Well known in the North, raised in the South
Connected out West get them in get them out

[Gucci Mane:]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[OJ Da Juiceman:]
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie Glass
Stupid Brick Squad chickens in stankin' through the plastic
Gettin 'em in and gettin' em gone; definition of a trapper
I'm the hottest thing walkin' around in East Atlanta
So I'm like a baby, shittin' like a damn pamper
They hatin' my swag, cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca cola where's the water? Watch this doe I serve this order
One on the window, cause the police just might smell this odor
Barber shops and beauty parlors, just to cover dirty dollars
White girl was super dirty, so I put her in the shower

[Gucci Mane:]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Waka Flocka Flame:]
Soo Woo! To the B Gang, it's a G thang, see me
I'm eyeballin' shorty, Gucci got the work and Flocka got the 40
Work the wheels, and hold the gun, smoke out my pistol, I wish you'd run
Nigga win some, like which one 100-round chopper or the handgun
Heard I ain't never lost none, I got nicks and dimes you want some
I'm a legend in the hood like Big Pun, got bales of the mid you want some, I got them
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything
I'm gudda gudda, gudda gudda, I put that shit on Gucci Mane
Brick Squad is what the fuck I claim, God y'all niggas off the chain (Loony)
Lookin' like he want my chain, I smoke him like some Mary Jane
And shorty that shit real talk
And shorty that shit real talk

[Gucci Mane:]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend

[Shawty Lo:]
Shawty Lo, call me Escobar
They try to retire me like the great Brett Favre
Still got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Even Nicki, fuckin' with my girlfriend
Yeah, we share that bitch
Got Waka Flocka, Gucci, Rocko in that bitch
Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist
And I'm still on the highway, takin' the risk
Back and forth, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20 with a bunch of them bricks
Ayy, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20, all white bricks

[Gucci Mane:]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang

[Yo Gotti:]
Feds coming after us, niggas talkin bout jackin us
Married to that white girl so bitch I ain't no bachelor
Brick Squad Re-up Gang, mothafuckin' yayo club
Lookin for another one cause I ran off on my last plug
Off white Jag, white truck, white Lambo
All white Porsche four door going ham ho
You know who I am ho (GOTTI!) You say I robbed yo brother
I don't give a damn though; he must've had the yams low
He must've had them grams off weighing what I paid for
Too many of them bands now he laying on his man floor
I'm Yo Gotti nigga and I'm from North Memphis
In East Atlanta Zone 6 and I got the North with me

[Gucci Mane:]

I got that hard Gucc, you know these bitches easy
I got that cold flu, I got that itchy sneezy
You in that Mitsubishi, I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm takin' trips with Papi, you walkie-talkie copy
I got them pookie fiends, might rock some Juicy jeans
I mean some Juicy sweats; maybe some blue Giuseppes
I play foul; no free-throw, bitch I ball, no free show
Deadass; no peep-show, bought our own condo, water-front condo
Daughter, son dundo; watchin' Telemundo
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
What'chu coppin'?
Keep that work inside my Pippi Longstocking, bitch

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Antisocial"
(feat. Mylah)



[HOOK]
Baby you dont have to treat me all anti
Why you wanna put me on standby
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire
We can stay up all night like vampires
Compliment each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you 10 times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left its like my heart died

Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said how you dont you trust me you did a homicide
Then said I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came at
Baby girl so bad, dis me but I aint mad
Now you wanna tease me
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie aint the kid, baby he could never be me

How you wanna go and act anti-social
Bet your man dont know you like I know you soldier
Maybe one day babe you gon get your mind right
And if you looking for me you can find me in the lam

[HOOK]
Baby you dont have to treat me all anti (Why)
Why you wanna put me on standby
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire (Hot)
We can stay up all night like vampires
Compliment each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you 10 times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside (Muah)
And every since she left its like my heart died

Oh Damn
Once upon a time a long time ago
I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me out coz she cant buy cheap shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch
Now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
Oh Damn!
Dats not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all boozie
9 years later and you're best friend choosie (muah)
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies (yeah)
Damn

Gucci dont gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want
Thats when she fantasized that I can't talk to her coz I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died (Gucci!)

[HOOK]
Baby you dont have to treat me all anti (Why)
Why you wanna put me on standby
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire (Hot)
We can stay up all night like vampires
Compliment each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you 10 times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside (Muah)
And every since she left its like my heart died
Oh Damn!

[MYLAH:]
Excuse me if I sound a little crazy
But just wanna be good to my baby
Coz he been holding me down
He give me everything I don't need no one around
But you're saying you can give it to me better
Give me hot like it's July and I'm rockin' a sweater
Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20
Her man's 2004
Maybe I'll give you a try
And keep it low
You ride
Something like, a test drive
See baby I get so in time

[GUCCI:]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Beat It Up"
(feat. Trey Songz)



[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's 4 in the mornin
She callin my phone
She wannna be grown
We gone get it on
She said that she lonely
Cause hes never around
Said she like my style
He can lay you down
Say he can lay you down
But I'm a beat it up
I'm a beat it up
I'm a beat it up
He can lay you down
But I'm a beat it up
I'm a beat it up

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I hopped up out my bed
Got my swag on
Stronger than filet mignon
Two Gs blown just for cologne
Money never limited
So Icey with benefits
My driver needs a passport
All my cars are immigrants!
It's so sickening
History you're witnessing
I had a girl she quit me
Now I'm single want to get with me?
Sticky again they stick to me
If you see your chick with GUCCI
Think before you confronting ruley
Ain't my fault your lady choosin
430 stepped on purp it
08 verty rollin dirty
Wardrobe clean as this detergent
Got your girlfriend picking purses
Say she lonely
Gucci only one with to meet me in person
When she met me home
My ***** told me that shes over first

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Your girlfriend keep callin me
I feel like she stalkin me
You at home
And she with me
So morning it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin it
Beatin her down
Straight poundin it
Drillin on your sheets
Got your blanket at the laundromat
Wait baby girl throw it back
Old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane not hardly that
Smack you like I'm mad at that
Swear this sex so passionate
Oral sex she mastered that
Pornographic poses
Like she posing for the internet
Wait I was not finished yet
Never been a minute man
Always been a business man
Gotta catch your feelings man
Got a man?
Oh really now?
Acting like I give a damn!

Used to like her now I don't
Got a real short attention span
GUCCI!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Trey Songz put it on
My shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song
She got on my favorite thong
She so hot
Too hot to touch
Truthfully too much for lames
Gucci mane I'm extra game
So extra rubbers I'm a bring
Got your main thang screaming GUCCI
Every tuesday night we cool whip
Wish we could do it more often
But I'm often somewhere flossin
Lay it down like carpet barbie
Aston martin double park it
Beat it like we got a problem
Pop her till she call me poppa
Freakin partners
Why we never bother with a second option
Hoppin got the mattress poppin
Rockin while her girlfriend watchin
Freakin partners
Why they never bother with a second option
Hoppin got the mattress poppin
Rockin while her girlfriend watchin
Guucci

[Chorus]

"I'm So Tired Of You"



Bitch
Multiply, Divide me, Then add on the remainder
I push more weight then a personal trainer
I get my gucci duffle bag and my hat off the shelf
I'm a stylelist of a star cause I style myself
And I'm dancin with the stars, dancin by myself
I was lost so I had to go an find myself
You can take all my well check's, Leave my health
Cause I cant count all this money think I need some help,
It's the franchise of zone 6 no jazze cheif
I got drumma boy on the track so don't hold your breathe
I'm so icy but my flow will make the soldiers melt
I sewed the game up like my granny sewed a quilt
                                              Gucci
Make a billion dollars what I'm tryna do
Gucci Mane La Flare I'm so tired of you
And if I had the time I would be sleepin too
But I'm workin these streets like a prostitute
They tell me rest up I say I leave the rest for you
Cause right now I'm chasin check's like a lawyer do
So don't bother me and I wont have to bother you
I'm just out here chasin cash like a monster fool

I got money on my mind like its changin my brain
And in the drought, water spout, gucci brings the rain
Aka the candy the candy cain, ain't proud of the fact I sold everything
And I done did all the drugs, but guess what gucci mane can sell out a club
An next guess ima have a major buzz
I'm so international I get london love

I'm no amateur my money skretches way past the perimeter
So hot I brake thermometer, my cash goes 3 kilometer's
In front of you is a conqueror, please don't sit on my furniture
My niggas stand right beside me, but your niggas up unda you

Make a billion dollars what I'm tryna do
Gucci Mane La Flare I'm so tired of you
And if I had the time I would be sleepin too
But I'm workin these streets like a prostitute
They tell me rest up I say I leave the rest for you
Cause right now I'm chasin check's like a lawyer do
So don't bother me and I wont have to bother you
I'm just out here chasin cash like a monster fool

I know your life's borin, you mad that I'm tourin
I'm in the studio until its 9 in the mornin
And I'm not even tired, look I'm not yawning
I'm headed to the airport I got a performance
I'm hot and your not, but shawty your warmin
So watch out for these haters, ain't not money in warin
Make em hate harder when they stop and you worry
I'm the man in the clutch call me gucci mane orion

Cocaina shawty thats a whole nother story
Cause to a hood bitch gucci's voice is your foray
Mic check ice check another recordin
Invest mission on the avenue's im explorin
                                    Gucci
Make a billion dollars what I'm tryna do
Gucci Mane La Flare I'm so tired of you
And if I had the time I would be sleepin too
But I'm workin these streets like a prostitute
They tell me rest up I say I leave the rest for you
Cause right now I'm chasin check's like a lawyer do
So don't bother me and I wont have to bother you

But I'm workin these streets like a prostitute

(feat. Bun B, Yo Gotti)



Are You Ready?

Spaghetti Junction

Water Whippin In The Kitchen
My Walkie Bitchern But I Aint Time For Stressin
Im Trying To Screction
I Hold Up My Whip With My Left Wrist

Roof Gone Get Your Present

Loudin Theres A Loudin
Got The Scrodin Count Up A Hundred Thousand
In My Long Johns I'm Up On These Suckas So I Get That Whitey Blocks
See These Niggas Need To Shop Wit Me Come Up On The Knot
Dope Boy Totin Up Four Hundred Thousand To The Lot
Where Them Keys To The Rolls Royce Choppin Like Its Hot
Nigga Try Before I Beat Your Man Give That Puff A Cot

With News Flash Nigga This Is Straight Off The Wire
My Blood Just GoT blood So His Ass Got To Retire
It Aint All Good Cause I Just Left The Streets Jack
They Say Its A Drought And The Hoods Off The Meatrack
The Trap Was Going Ham Now Its Full Blown Pig
And Yours In The Streets Itll Split Your Full Grown Wig
And Niggas On That Bullshit Sellin Wax And Drywall
Careful Who You're Scoring From Niggas Bound To Dry Out
Me I'm The Trill-O G So I Aint Trippin On 'Em

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Normal"



Hit the mall spend 30 like the shit normal
Me and my broad nothing but gucci, louis, ferragamo
Drop racks, get it back
Call the shit karma
Fuckin models when I want
All your hoes normal
Blowing kush
What your smokin smellin really normal
Ask me if I wanna hit it
I don't really wanna
Pulled up, old school, paint willy wonka
Cuts all white, but the rims abnormal
Backseat on my rolls in my silk pajamas
Hoppin out in house shoes like the shit normal
Change my jewelery every day cuz it the summer
If yo bitch want my number
Chill, it's really normal

[Chorus]
Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal
Ice game dumb dumb, now it's even dumber
You normal
I'm so cold I need a thermal
Drumma boy track
Drumma, this another comma
It's my summer
She think her ass is far from normal
It's no wonder her boyfriend keep a stupid number
My summer, she think her ass is far from normal
No wonder her boyfriend get that stupid llama

He pull up in a honda
tThat's normal
I pull up in a zonda same color lasagna
My goons'll put you under
Confront us
Got guns like super contra
Stay armored
You bought your girl some (ahh ahh)
Don't want 'em
My girl got on piranhas
That's abnormal
My bracelet cost a honda
That's abnormal
We'll rob you where I come from
That's a promise
She's a snake charmer
Anaconda
Real man eat her
Like jeffrey dahlmer
I can't stand people mad cuz
Their lives are normal
I got long money, bitch
Put it on my momma

[Chorus]
Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal
Ice game dumb dumb, now it's even dumber
You normal
I'm so cold I need a thermal
Drumma boy track
Drumma, this another comma
It's my summer
She think her ass is far from normal
It's no wonder her boyfriend keep a stupid number
My summer, she think her ass is far from normal
No wonder her boyfriend get that stupid llama

Bad bitches be stuntin me
They all wanna fuck, they warnin me
So I told her to kiss her homegirl
She said "i don't do that normally"
Shit I don't do shit the normal way
Gotta fuck with me the enormous way
Back in the day, humongous yay
I don't do that front shit normally
Me and flocka rockin iced out ornaments
Make a hit then start performin it
Got a club funked out like parliament
Brick squad we ain't with all the normal shit
She a dime piece, but you a normal bitch
Real ?? max girl can't work the stick
Won't touch the girl, nor hit the girl
She's just a normal ass chick in a normal world
It's gucci baby, you a gucci girl
Het a one way ticket to gucci's world
Where night time it even gets warmer baby
Don't fuck with him, he too normal baby
It's gucci baby, you a gucci lady
Pull my dick out make you say "gucci's crazy"
Night time it even gets warmer baby
Don't fuck with him, he too normal baby

[Chorus]
Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal
Ice game dumb dumb, now it's even dumber
You normal
I'm so cold I need a thermal
Drumma boy track
Drumma, this another comma
It's my summer
She think her ass is far from normal
It's no wonder her boyfriend keep a stupid number
My summer, she think her ass is far from normal
No wonder her boyfriend get that stupid llama

"Georgia's Most Wanted"



I Spend My Winter In Jail So I'm Balling All Summer
Bad Bitches On My Tail Hunt Me Like a Bounty Hunter
Never Shout Out A Tip For My Momma Never Had A Daughter
Pussy Niggas Scared Of Me See Through You Like A Bottle Of Water

Hundred Bottles Opened Up
Still Slaggin Opiou
Smokin At The Atrium
Its all Hell I'm Still Makin Plays

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Tell Me What You Wanna Do?
What You wanna Do?
I Got Killas On The Rooftop All On The Rooftop
Who You Wanna Shoot But I Dont Wanna Go Back
You Dont Wanna Do That Why You Gotta Prove That?
What You Gotta Prove These Niggas Better Move Back
Shoes Come In Two Stacks Ima Take A Few Back
What You wanna Do? Im Choking On That Fruit Pack
Why Would You Woo That?
Crazy Color Coupe What You Wanna Do?

[Verse]
Sippin On The Loot (Eghh)
Im Walkin From The Car Line Straight To The Boost
So My Swagger Through The Roof
I Got Money Too This What Money Do
My Shoes Came From The Zoo
My Cane Came From Paroon
My Car Paint Pyroon
Piss Body Say Sawoo
My Earings Came In Blue
We Walk In Different Hues
See Me On The News
My Lawyer Is A Shoe
In Case You wanna Sue
I Got Alot Of Scoons
Your Beef Aint Nothing New
I pull Up In A Coupe
Same Color As a Suit
And I Aint Got On A Suit
I Pull Up Blossom Blue
My Rim Right By The Pool
I Said Look At The View
Tell Me What You Wanna Do

[Chorus]
Tell Me What You Wanna Do?
What You wanna Do?

Conduct Yourself One Class On Me Tasha Dont Disturb Me
Describe Your Body You're Like A Circus You're Unreliable
I Want The Cash The Car All The Girls Im Entitled To
My White Grand Like Them rich White Girls Back Then
Ass Banquets Like Paying Texas On A Back Hand
Gucci Mane Air Train How I Fly The Hoes In
Would Be My Good Friend Till I Put My Golds In
Now Ive Crossed The Globe Boy I Stick My Nose In
Ten Thousand Diamond Dollar Loafers I Put My Toes In
Fresh Boy The Post Man The Books Are Closed
They Might Not Re-Open Cause You Niggas Is Hoes

[Chorus]
Tell Me What You Wanna Do?
What You wanna Do?
I Got Killas On The Rooftop All On The Rooftop
Who You Wanna Shoot But I Dont Wanna Go Back

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Cowards & Soldiers"
(with DJ Drama)



[Verse 1]
My trap house chill like Morehouse I got niggas all around it
But yo trap like a whore house probly in there cooking brownies
Spell me, spell me, ain't nothing you can tell them
My goons all trained to go but you squad more pussy then Spellman
We stomp you like the Q-Dogs aka Alpha Kappa
Gambling with a poolshark find your body after later
College campus kush pack, three blunts make the party start
Don't make me start burning kush then start burning your body parts
Zone 6 still ma I'm a model, I'm valedictorian
Girl just broke up with me say I fucked the whole sorority
Retarted all the time I was bumpin' and choppin' authority
Tell it to my nine, 'cause you bitch niggas be boring me

[Hook]
He's got made for teenagers scary you can't join
But if you have the heart we can link up and have fun
They drink up all of the fuck if the lockers were made of bud
'Cause these cowards die as a thousand and soldiers they die as one
You know it's what these bitches in Atlanta keep goin'
Don't keep up the security we see 'em we keep blowin'
No glory for the team with scarce money and no guns
'Cause a coward die as a thousand and soldiers they die as one

[Verse 2]
I empty out the clip, believe me that's not a myth
I murk you on the scrifin' one question I plead the fifth
Your kush pack and my cocaine whiter than Taylor swift
And they tailor make my bread and dine collar costs me a grip
I'm cleaner than a whistle black diamonds matchin' my pistols
So beefin' with me nigga best keep yo head on a swivel
Quarter ticket every week and you dig it that's how I kick it
So you can leave the money and you can have all the bitches
Pardon my apology rappers these days not as hard as me
Avoiding me that's obviously cause they know they just frosted me
I brought to me you softer than Charmin and that's not hard to see
I own the street every beat that I spit on my fans applauded me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm back in the Maybach I'm blowin Kush in the back
Eight thousand dollars for the set, time to roll me another fat
The police pull me over they think of gon' catch a trap
Don't know it's only personal uses what's up with that
My wrist and knicks so rocksy I'm choppin' game up with Terrance (BURR)
I'm worn all 6 import talkin' cockin' thanks to my parents (BURR)
You strippers seen 10K worth of singles they squeeze they nipples
I tempt one till she twiddle and that's a bitch 'till she cripple
I keep word to a minimal rappers now wanna hush
I got to say too much 'cause my jewelry can't says enough (BURR)
I'm keep 'em up that's why you niggas ain't deep enough
You say you poppin' deep dish yo pockets ain't deep enough

[Hook]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Dats My Life"



[Verse 1]
They overdosing on my swag, put the whole goddamn hood in rehab
Too many ruffles in my duffle, can't close this bag it's so much cash
I need ten hands now to count my stash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm bad
Never need a mask, better check my stash you must be hallu-ci-na-tin'
First day out girl ain't you glad, six supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinkin' outta gold bottle with some true religions jeans saggin'
off my ass
Please don't crash, am I goin' too fast, touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum 'cause I'm fixin' to talk trash 'cause I keep 'em on task like a kid in class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
I told you forty haters sure can't see me
Wouldn't know what hit if I hit 'em in the head with a four by four standin' six foot three
Ready for my bitch crocodile the sheet
Never met a girl ain't fuck first week
You never met a G throw a $10,000 white mink on the floor live on B.E.T.

[Chorus]
Only got one life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you can watch the show chillin' at your crib
And please turn the music up so I can jam
But I be smokin' 'dro
I'ma fuck some hoes
I'm about a day wake up and then go buy some more
They tell a grown man what to do with his
Is your prerogative I'ma mind my biz
But I'ma live a life
Forever rockin' ice
Throwin' money, poppin' bottles because that's just what I like
But I'ma live a life
Forever rockin' ice
Throwin' money poppin' bottles because that's just what I like
That's just what I like

[Verse 2]
Screamin' I'mma Be like The Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best be ease if you really want breeze I'll fly you by the trees lookin' like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinkin' bout sleep
Bet yo favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like a down street noise over soon as the leather feet touch concrete
When I'm south-beach blowin' on tree
Whippin' down the street like I'm ridin' on D's
A new Ferrari flyin' down B street girl like roll your window down Gucci Mane please May 12, 2010 I'm free
Caught up in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumpin' out the roof but we don't need water please bring more weed
Gucci Mane win now they want to switch teams
Can't entertain that by no means
Wan to get on nigga chase your dreams
Stop chasin' me down like a dope fiend
Startin' off my day with a M-16
Shit ain't been the same since I turned sixteen
Whole life changed after so icy first album on the charts came out same week Gucci

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak
Wrote me every week real talk that's deep
Ex cell mate got a thirty-five piece
Won't be released 'till 2033
On the same birthday my boy turned 3
And lookin' at him is like I'm lookin' at me
Can't look back watch the moves I make for the moves that I make fuck around and make me Gucci

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Making Love To The Money"



[Chorus:]
Makin love to the money
I swear the sex great
I kicked them hoes out
but let the money stay
makin love to the money like a sex tape
I'm talkin kim k I'm talkin Ray J
makin love to the money on the interstate
can't keep my hands off her
we on a dinner date
I'm makin love to my money
shawty keep me str8
I cant live without her
I fuck her everyday

[Verse 1:]
Shawty stay by my side when I started grindin
she the main reason why a nigga shinin
strippers cant see me all this money flyin
30 yrs old talkin bout retirin
I'ma show these hoes who the king of diamonds soon as I walk in the king of diamonds
she broke up wit me once almost had me cryin
she knew that I was cheatin cause she caught me lyin
king of the jungle I'ma lion
white line at the house
we named it Miley Cyrus
she never talk back baby very private
she got me talkin shit but she kinda quiet

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I gotta take her every where
cause these niggas crazy
only leave her by herself
on special occasions
I love makin love cause she so amazing
when I bring her to the club
them hoes be goin crazy
every nigga in the hood
wanna fuck my lady
cant wait for me to slip
so they can take my baby
she get me outta jams
or tight situations
love aint got no cut off point
aint no limitations
she got me in that dice sittin on them thangs
we strikin out them hoes dont look at me the same but fuck it they aint gotta fuck wit me at all
I pick my baby up & took her to the mall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now baby aint no angel
but she a keeper
before she dealt wit me
she dealt wit some real evil people
she bought me ak's call it desert eagles
cocaine hammer pills man its stupid regals
I took her from her ex yeaa he kinda cheap
the very day she left
we started beepin
and she dont ever lie to me
she keep it real
your bitch keep comin short
my bitch keep wearin heels
she keep on standin tall
she never stand me up
she'll go to war wit anybody
she dont give a fuck
she help me keep it in the road
like a hub cap
so I keep her on my mind
like a skull cap

[Chorus]

"Long Money"



[Chorus]
Jacuzzi on the roof ugly, hoes dont keep the time of day,
cheefin on some teefa smell the reefa from a mile away,
pistol in my coop try my troops you'll get blown away,
Gucci Mane got long money bitch thats all I got to say

Gucci mane got long, thats wht them bitches say [3x]
I don't even gotta talk my money conversate

Intresting got a money tree, I drown a bitch in money, farrari with the boam beats,
forgiatos and a bunyon. (How many karats in that braclet?)
I think about 200, plus I hit the club with 50k lets keep this shit 100,
got a couple houses,several spouses in my pin house smoking ounces,
came up selln keys and ounces, half a pound whit gold and brown,
my pants sagging grams were them down, use to catch a train and go downtown,
use to walk around and window shop now I shut the mall down everytime (Gucci!)
Everytime I hit the seen fresher than I want to be,
cover of the magazine back of the limozine
(Yeaa), stacks in my denim jeans hoes gonna remember,
458 ship me to facility (nyoo) 6 12's sittn outside the vacility
911 Gucci Mane ice game killn me, came a long way from drug dealing waking up rich is a great feeling,
couple missed steps from a grand children just hand counted me a cool half million, up on them,
pull up on them like a bird drop a load and shit on them,
piss on them spit on them, tell them hatersd gucci got rich on them.

[Chorus]
Jacuzzi on the roof ugly hoes dont keep the time of day,
cheeefin on some teefa smell the reefa from a mile away,
pistol in my coop try my troops you'll get blown away
Gucci Mane got long money bitch that's all I got to say

Gucci Mane got long money, thats what them bitches say [3x]
I don't even gotta talk my money converste.

Pitty I make magic I make money dissappear,
Its a tragity how clear this diamonds blinging in my ear,

"Boogeyman"



Ghea, this the mixtape nigga
I got trap money nigga
I ain't even gotta rob if I want to nigga
I'm bustin' things out the wrap nigga
Every day nigga, crazy plays nigga
Ghea, y'all niggas know 'bout the kid
Y'all niggas know y'all scared of me
Nigga, you know I'm like the boogeyman
Y'all niggas scared, tuck ya chain in bitch
Gucci Mane La Flare, what's the muthafuckin' business
Ya pussy, scary-ass nigga, I don't never see y'all bitch ass niggas better watch yo' mouth nigga
Beat those drums

I'm the man 'round here, hundred grand in this bitch
Gucci Mane 'round here, understand over dig
Gucci Mane, I'm the man, thousand pounds of mid grade
Make a Friday outta goddamn Wednesday
Hundred grand, Gucci Mane, you my friend lend me
Mr. Floyd diamonds got me lookin' just like Diddy
Bart Simpson chain and its shittin' on the low
Wanna beat my chain, gotta spend a lil' mo'
Magic City blaze nigga, where you gonna go man?
Scared to see my face 'cause you know you just a ho man
Prayin' I won't slap yo' ass on the fuckin' low man
Magic City blaze platinum, ain't nowhere to go man
Couple niggas murdered but them niggas deserved it
Gucci Mane La Flare, man I'm hungry and I'm thirsty
Wearin nothin' but Baileys, Gucci sneakers, never jersey
Gucci Mane La Flare, I don't think them pussys heard me
I ain't need a hundred niggas to get myself on
I still got them units, nigga hit me on my phone
I ain't need Sean Carter, I mix wit' the water
Give that shit a turnaround and cup her in the Charger
Damn, got the bleach and washing powder
I got ten G's, he make ten dollars an hour
Want some cocaine but I served his ass some flour
I count ten G's, he make ten dollars an hour
Young Gucci Gucci, I'm the Gucci Mane
I got them kilos cookies, call me the cookie man
Damn I make it rain, make it hurricane
I make Katrina, I make it Katrina
Throwin' mothafuckin' hundred dollars like a frisbee
Smokin' on the drizzy, got yo' baby momma dizzy
Uh and yo' nigga just a worker
I brought you to yo' momma house, smellin' like purple

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Dollar Sign"



[Chorus]
I'm so fucking paid I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign

Please man call Obama I wanna buy the dollar sign
Just like first day of school my swag killed em like colombine
The dollar signs my logo and guccis my clothing line
Put on that purple label polo and them hoes say damn he fine
Should be able to keep her so I keep her
Feed her treat her like a diva
My fetish in costa rica cuz she know that I'm a cheater
What up the cost of living
I feel like a trillion bucks
Got beef with a million fuck niggas I dont give a fuck
? on south beach where my house is
Any where on earth my turf but I'm so down south aligator couches
A public service announcement
Gucci so fucking paid pay 2 stacks just for a fade
Bitches surfing on my waves

[Chorus]

By the bar and I own the club
Cant own the bar cuz I'm superstar
I'm so turnt up cant turn me down
Blowing punds thats higher than jupiter
I'm hot turning up lucifer
At club crucial in a stoopid car
Every verse my flow gets stoopider
My producer dont want to produce for ya
? my bank account on steroids
My stash aint got no room for it
New drop head paid cash for it
Ferrari 220 on the dashboard
Long rich nigga wait here his crash course
I pull up to the club in a fast porche
When I leave all the hoes give a sad voice
Got bills to pay and things to do
New hoes to screw and business moves
Imma business man whats the business plan
Used to rip it in the band for the extra grand
I'm successful man hell yes I am
Dead fresh I am bought an extra lamb
And I dont never ask how much it cost
Thats silly cuz I dont really give a damn

[Chorus]

"Trap Talk"



Started out with blood money
50k in drugs on me
[?] put thugs on me
Just pulled up in the club homey
We just put my thugs on it
Home boy gettin his mug on
Hey I wanna get my buzz on
Fuck around I'll put my gloves on
Say no robbin how I eat
B.c 32 that's my street
Brick squad runners 10 million deep
I'm tryin to sell 10 billion keys
Fuck what a bitch boy say to me
AKA I stay with me
Mac 99 not far away my dogs don't even play with me
In my apartment 80 a piece
Stack a piece 80 g's
Old skool dope rider front
Off set shots 73
You say he's a traper pleas
I hang around with a gang of thieves
They prolly charge 200g's then sell your ass a sack of leaves
Gucci mane fuck up the sound
Dead drunk like my uncle
Touch my brother dood n I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat
Gucci mane fuck up the sound
Dead drunk like my uncle
Touch my brother dood n I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran strait threw it
Got numbers in my blow spot my trap house boomin talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk
I'm still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some meny chops and glock no need to keep the door locked
Bitch I'm talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk

55 white bricks fronted to me
23 thous 5h unit a piece
357 sit on top of the seats
Plus a air 15 ain't far from my reach
Got a house on flat shore sell nothin but dro
Apartment on the crest ware I get all the blow
Went from pan to perform till 80s show
Now a 26 a shocks sit up unda the rows
A nigga think he playin with me betta play with his nose
Put a hole in his chest bout the size of a mole
I gota j that swing my door and I pay them in dope
I got cookers on my team that snort and I pay them in coke

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran strait threw it
Got numbers in my blow spot my trap house is boomin talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk
I'm still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some meny chops and glock no need to keep the door locked
Bitch I'm talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk

There's not no one in the game with more swagger than this
Cause I can score with any hoe with just the flick of my wrist
Diamonds sittin on my finger cost ten bricks of the sniff
For this matchin cardia 20 bags of tha pills
You can talk n say your sick but I ain't goin legit
Tryna think of the newest murder gonna drop him again
Flow harder than running water
Tatted up like Travis Barker
More swag than your baby father
Wrist colder than northan border
Lang gonna get you life in order
Squares don't get no likin on
Have my goons out back and slaughter
Fuck around find you stinkin partner
Thesis diamonds in this bitch look like newvo on my fist
This shits with a twist so I keep a new bitch on my dick

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran strait threw it
Got numbers in my blow spot my trap house boomin talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk
I'm still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some meny chops and glock no need to keep the door locked
Bitch I'm talkin trap talk

"Don't Believe Me"



Drumma Boy
Brrr (Hey boy)
Big Gucci (Hey)
Yo playa (Hey boy)
Brrr

I got a homie named Frankie (Frankie), last name Mueller
And he hang with my panky (Panky), ice cooler
And my role you should thank me (Thank me), thank my jeweler
'Cause he got me so icy (Brrr)
If another hater try to take my jewelry, I'ma probably have to go and pick a jury
I'm goin' M6 karats, can you hear me?
I'm so flashy, suckas can't stand near me
When I be a granddad, I tell my grandchildren
When I was 30 years old, I had 30 million
Came a long way from trappin' in a vacant building 60,000 people screaming such a great feelin' (Gucci)

Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back
You don't believe that and I don't believe that
We just don't believe that

It is not that easy
You gon' have to try harder to deceive me
Before I ever started gettin' rap money (Money)
I was wrappin' up them things like a mummy (Dummies)
Your whole crew like food for my tummy
And I'm hungry right now so its ovey
I'm the hood MVP with a trophy (A trophy)
I got five rings on like I'm Kobe (I'm Kobe)
I'm puttin' it down like my good partner Toby (Toby)
He in the feds, yeah, them people gave him 40
I'm still ridin' around the city with the .40 (Shawty)
I think what the fuck I wanna think just run up on me (On me)

Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back
You don't believe that and I don't believe that
We just don't believe that

I just got a text message, should I say a sex message?
Say she got an ice fetish, told her get her mouth ready
Hydro got my light-headed, Lambo got her sightseein'
Not the average human bein' so I'm ridin' in European
Paid 'em and I bring 'em in, start out friends and end up fuckin'
Please don't ask her once again, they at my hotel goin' in
Gucci Mane be goin' in, fuck your throat, go again
DJ hit my ho again, tell me what you recommend
I put it down, I fly em in, fly 'em out then go again
I get around like 2Pac 94' but its 2010
17 Brick Squad Records, I'm a busy man
Stay out Gucci business, this ain't where the rings on Gucci hands

Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back

"Yeahhh (Pop Your Back)"
(feat. Blanco, Dorrough)



[Intro:]
Brr
Cookin' Soul
It's Gucci
I'm Mr. Zone 6, what hatnin'?
Yeah, yeah

[Gucci Mane:]
I ain't bullshittin'
Gucci bout his business
Twelve tryin' catch me they got me jumpin' fences
Loose chain comin' in as eighteen inches
Fifteen five blunt gettin' with the quickness
I'm no lawyer I'm no doctor
Gucci Mane a mobster, I smoke it like a robster
Pounds like Gotham, feels like pasta
Iced out, lookin' made your girlfriend jockin'
Somebody stop him, somebody get him
He crazy as a fool and he got them goons with him
Somebody stop him, somebody get him
He crazy as a fool and he got them goons with him

Three girls with me, three girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back

[Blanco:]
I don't need to brag, my swag do the talkin'
I don't need the Jag', I just bought because I was shoppin'
I was feelin' kind of bored, like fuck it, I'll cop it
I brought a duffle bag just instead it was a problem
Yeah, I cashed out, then I smashed out
There's bad bitches at the crib, all passed out
And they waitin' on me and y'all hatin' on me
I smell the success, the ho said they taste it on me
Yeah, I'm a triple OG
Like I smoke a lotta weed, make you sip a lil' lean
See, I'm every ho's dream and a dude's worst nightmare
Movin' hoes out, it's the truth, I swear

[Gucci Mane:]
Three girls with me, three girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back

[Dorrough:]
I'm in the club, lookin' good, bitches like me
I ain't gotta dress, I could wear a white tee
Hoes boppin' 'cause they see me with my chain on
I'm a G, I ain't gotta run game
'Cause bitch I'm gettin' paid, I pop collars
Signed independent, gettin' independent dollars
Makin' independent moves, yes I do
Lil' mama got friends, tell 'em bring them too
We could all make love, all make love
Liquor in my body as I'm walkin' through the club
I think I see a cutie, lookin' like she up-to-par
Girl, male cookie bar
Said she want a superstar
You could flip it better here, go make a DO double R
On a long-ass dick, I could hit her from afar
Better watch out, I'll hook your chick
If the bitch got friends, I'll fuck her clique
I'll make 'em say "yeah"

[Gucci Mane:]
Yeah, brr
Yeah, yeah, yeah, brr
Yeah, yeah

Three girls with me, three girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back

I need everybody to report to tha dance floor right now

Dime piece time piece got my Swiss movin

I think I need an ESPY the rappers best respect me 
They try to ron Artest me the gone have to arrest me 
With a doubt I bring em out 
The kid is all she think about 
She cheated wit la flare but he didn't spill a drink about her
Do you know what time it is 
Gucci time

I'm hood rich wealthy and all that there 
All time [?] have no idea 

[Chorus - x2:]

Amazin like my bracelet I'm flossin r.i.p the mike the ice got my chest moon walkin 
Cabbage patchin bouncin like bankin
Pull up in the drop top ferrari on bank head 
Colder than a polar bear sleepin in the freezer
She wish she never met me wanna catch amnesia 
Gucci mane crazy I mite pull up on a zebra
Land on top a eagle smoke a joint of reefa
Standin on the sofa spillin liquor on the speaker 
Call the paralegal cuz this shit should be illegal

[Chorus - x2:]
Its gucci time!

Cut these fuckin lights on
All this ice on
No need to cut the lights on

"It's Alive"
(feat. Swizz Beatz)



[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, burrr burrr
This is special, GUCCCI
Its Gucci, thats what you mean huh..righht? right..
Ladies and gentleman, showtime

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
My pocket on swole, my rims on chrome
When I hit the club, everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I dont really care
Cuz I ride on em, I style on em
I lean on em, yes, I flash on em
Yeh I know, thats the way you like it, huh, yeh
Thats the way you love me, huh? Its alive..its alive

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's alive, it's alive
Rims cut the eyes
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein
I push weight, but Gucci don't exercise
I get extra from whippin up extra pies
Im in the hood like the mayor round election time
It's a suggestion, don't park your car next to mine
Ima start when the light hit, Im 'posed to shine
Your flow is garbage, they let me out just in time
They got a section, but none of the hoes are fine
They need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by
I run laps around lames with my shoes untied
I jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide
Still stuck outside, that's the ugly side
Looked medusa in the eye and medusa died
This is top secret shit, classified
Don't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind
Can't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time
I got my chain moonwalkin, Michael Jackson time
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind
This bloodline of mine is supposed to shine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Hurry up, hurry up Gucci on the news, they say he walked out the jail rockin stupid jewels
They try and find out what it do, admit it, you confused
Too much cash on me, hundreds fallin out me, true
Big yellow wrists, bright as piss, bitch Im the shit
Big Gucci called Swizz, lets make a hit
2 things in this world I ain't ever seen
Are you a foreigner nigga? I need to help me get me me
Well if your stomach cannot tote it baby, let me breathe
Cuz I dont check if no babe or bitch chasin me
Excuse my French, bitch Im so Gucci, I so fuckin gutter
It dont make no sense to switch for none these mother fuckas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
Somebody said my life is it
I said nah dog, my wife is it
Now I'm back, back on 'em like I never, never left
Plus the boy right here, I'm fresh to death
And the Black Card in my back pocket
The Conaseg lookin' like a speeder rocket
Yeah, I'm zoomin' on the highway
And you should love me, I did it my way

[Hook]

[Rick Ross:]
My bitch the baddest, it may be the statis
Maybe my Astin, maybe black magic
Maybe I'm destand, maybe it's blessings
Maybe my cubans just got me connected
I may be the best, no second guessing

Boots cost a stack, that's just 10 hundreds
I never subtract, I been 100

[Rocko:]
M A Y B E, I'm fly
That's why I got your bitch with me right now
She say she not bi, so I told her bye
She say ok, maybe I'll try
Maybe cause she know, she know I'm that guy
Or maybe cause I get all this m o n e y
Or maybe it's my oral, got her blowin up my team
Blinga bling, yello all on my ding a ling
Maybe cause I'm on, they wanna scrue me
Maybe it's that new shit, got them throwing that cucci
Maybe cause she heard I slang that wood very good
Maybe that's why she staring, maybe that's why she ready to do it

Maybe it's my car, maybe cause I'm flexin
Maybe it's my wrist, bitch, got the bitch getting naked
Maybe it's my bracelet, maybe it's my chain
Maybe it's my swagger, got your bitch off the chain
Maybe cause I'm on, maybe it's my guns
Maybe it's my calone, got your bitch wanna fuck me
Maybe it's the way I'm thuggin, like the way we be kicken it
Maybe it's all this money, she like the way we getting it

[Gucci Mane:]
She on my wave like a surf board, I'm swang, I'm overboard
That lady ain't lay up, signed the rrent to the landloard
I'm gwapped up, stay gwapped up
So much bread, it's a lunch
I go wherever you go, black card in your circle
Yeah, that's that attention defesit, got ATT, I got ETT
With Rocko, cause he ADD, if you ain't a dime piece then don't speak to me
I'm in that drop, no simpothy
If you ain't got a range, then don't speak to me
Over ice, got polar ice, my pinckey ring liking like chorus light
Me and Rocko, we robbin, make them hate me, no maybe
Keep buying these fararis like I'm crazy, cause I'm crazy
You said you my baby, no yes or probably or maybe
Wanna be with Radrick Davis, no probably, no maybe
It's Gucci!

[Rocko:]
Maybe it's my car, maybe cause I'm flexin
Maybe it's my wrist, bitch, got the bitch getting naked
Maybe it's my bracelet, maybe it's my chain

Pull up in that drop, that money, man, I'm spendin it
What's on my credit card, you know that thing unlimmited
Told you tell them I blow it, I'm turned up to the maximom
Shaudy wanna lick me, look at how my diamonds flexin
Ball out in the club, fuck all them lame niggas
But they gonna wanna touch, maybe I bust their brain, nigga
Me and Rocko, you know we doing it big time
ATL on deck, we goin shine bout 10 times
Go tell m, westside, that be my naiborhood
Dropped on that grill, these days, my drop top's legs are wood

Fuck it, I don't care.
The Appeal!
When I fucking came to this fucking country,
All I had was a dollar and a dream.

[Verse 1:]
We need more Ros, My bitches gettin' thristy, 
My words like New Years, Christmas came early, (BuRR!)
Got these bitches urling, my earring's perfect, 
My left pinkey finger rolling like George Gervin, 
My name ain't Ervin, but call me Magic.
Abra Cadabra, top off the Phathom, 
458 Italia, first in the states, out of town plates, just to make it look great.
I need a haircut, plus a carwash.
I get out the car and they take their bra's off.
See I fought the law and the fuckin law won, 
Came back on Appeal wanna new outcome, 
Overload your eardrumbs, hear it hear it come! 
Income Income, go and get you sum.
Say bye to the Bad guy, Wave bye to the Bad guy, Gucci Mane the bad guy.
Yes, I am the Bad guy, Wave bye to the Bad guy.

[Chorus:]
I came to this country with a dollar and a dream and a choppa and a team full of killas, what you mean?
Imma bad guy, bad guy from start til the end
Say hello to my little friend
I couldve been a doctor, shouldve been a lawyer
I go to court so much I couldve been my own employer
Imma die a dope boy, always been a hustla, 
Started off custom now I (Say hello to my little friend)

[Verse 2 - Bun B:]
.......

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I got 60 racks laying on the floor in magic city
Like Samuel L Jackson I think it's time for killing
I touched his wife titty and the nigga start tripping
That ain't proper etiquette you see the bitch stripping

AR-15 whipped his ass into pieces
Don't get it twisted think it's all about the pieces
And all about the bracelets 
I'm still fighting cases 
10 thousand for the glasses 
Diamonds in they faces (BuRR, BuRR)

Your own blood taste it 
We stomp you till you tasteless
My t-shirt ain't tailored... 

You read what is said - bitch
Brick squad bossman off with you head - bitch
Run for the exit 

They shooting inside here
Parking lot gun fight bodies outside here
Police best bet come with the riot gear
Soldiers down to die here

Move to America 
Dollar and a dream and a donor picture, tear it up

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Trap Talk"



Started out with blood money
50k in drugs on me
[?] put thugs on me
Just pulled up in the club homey
We just put my thugs on it
Home boy gettin his mug on
Hey I wanna get my buzz on
Fuck around I'll put my gloves on
Say no robbin how I eat
B.c 32 that's my street
Brick squad runners 10 million deep
I'm tryin to sell 10 billion keys
Fuck what a bitch boy say to me
AKA I stay with me
Mac 99 not far away my dogs don't even play with me
In my apartment 80 a piece
Stack a piece 80 g's
Old skool dope rider front
Off set shots 73
You say he's a traper pleas
I hang around with a gang of thieves
They prolly charge 200g's then sell your ass a sack of leaves
Gucci mane fuck up the sound
Dead drunk like my uncle
Touch my brother dood n I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat
Gucci mane fuck up the sound
Dead drunk like my uncle
Touch my brother dood n I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran strait threw it
Got numbers in my blow spot my trap house boomin talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk
I'm still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some meny chops and glock no need to keep the door locked
Bitch I'm talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk

55 white bricks fronted to me
23 thous 5h unit a piece
357 sit on top of the seats
Plus a air 15 ain't far from my reach
Got a house on flat shore sell nothin but dro
Apartment on the crest ware I get all the blow
Went from pan to perform till 80s show
Now a 26 a shocks sit up unda the rows
A nigga think he playin with me betta play with his nose
Put a hole in his chest bout the size of a mole
I gota j that swing my door and I pay them in dope
I got cookers on my team that snort and I pay them in coke

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran strait threw it
Got numbers in my blow spot my trap house is boomin talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk
I'm still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some meny chops and glock no need to keep the door locked
Bitch I'm talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk

There's not no one in the game with more swagger than this
Cause I can score with any hoe with just the flick of my wrist
Diamonds sittin on my finger cost ten bricks of the sniff
For this matchin cardia 20 bags of tha pills
You can talk n say your sick but I ain't goin legit
Tryna think of the newest murder gonna drop him again
Flow harder than running water
Tatted up like Travis Barker
More swag than your baby father
Wrist colder than northan border
Lang gonna get you life in order
Squares don't get no likin on
Have my goons out back and slaughter
Fuck around find you stinkin partner
Thesis diamonds in this bitch look like newvo on my fist
This shits with a twist so I keep a new bitch on my dick

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran strait threw it
Got numbers in my blow spot my trap house boomin talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk
I'm still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some meny chops and glock no need to keep the door locked
Bitch I'm talkin trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin trap talk

"What It's Gonna Be"



Listen to the track bitch

Burr burr burr

I'm in the zone they keep on gettin offended
But ain't did nothing wrong but tightened up all my business
And now I'm making millions, everybody's social
They really too emotional I don't have time to hold them
I wanna be a billionaire, me too
So I can count a billion cash in hundreds on you too
I get dirty money bitches know with ciroc on my rada
I'm on stage with diddy nicki ricky rozay and flo rida
I rock maris with the money ball like stoudemire omare
Hold the blunt with my left hand to show my audemar in paris
Look at all that I've accomplished, I just bought me 3 ferraris
Spent five million in my company if offended you not sorry...GUCCI

[Chorus]
What it gonna be
What it ain't gonna be
Too many chains on me too many rings on me
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze
What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Dare anybody here to put their hands on me
Too many stacks on me so many racks on me 
Got some killa and some gats and money
What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Too many chains on me too many rings on me
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze
What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Dare anybody here to put their hands on me
Too many stacks on me so many racks on me 
Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be

Ima street magician and I keep on taking pretty girls to lenox
New mustang with 80 in it watch her spend all 80 in 80 minutes
Sacks are full real true religion I bought a car so sharp it makes the feds suspicious
See I'm too flamboyant they say its malnutrious I'm in a rare edition, think I'm a mathematician
Dare anybody here to put their hands on me too many stacks on me too many racks on me 
Gotta die on my life as whats it gonna be whatcha gonna do gucci mane gonna lead
Still poppin bottles pouring liquor on chicks no need to lie I'm such a freak 
No need to hide you so unique
Imma try beat your back out until you weep
Said you ran outta money theres more for me heres more for you cause you a whore for me
Dont be a hoe for free cause we can ball right now we can do it 2, 3, 4 times a week
From zone 6 down to Camelton I pull up in that yellow thing I put rims on everything
Hoes think I gotta wedding ring

What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Too many chains on me too many rings on me
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me

Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze
What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Dare anybody here to put their hands on me
Too many stacks on me so many racks on me 
Got some killa and some gats and money
What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Too many chains on me too many rings on me
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze
What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Dare anybody here to put their hands on me
Too many stacks on me so many racks on me 
Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be

Come in to leave throwin money high dont care where it reach
Spend 2 g's a week on haircuts like 4,5,6 sometimes a week
These girls petrified they scared to speak
Im in the new GT with a georgia peach
Gotta condo right out on the florida beach
I aint hard to reach so nice to meet
Every night we meet you prolly fight with me
Say its fine with me to spend the night with me
No rules everything alright with me
Now shake baby shake just right for me
Catch ball players in magic city
Show them boys how good my jumper is
Aint no niggas up in here, makin all pros look like amateurs
I just showed my ass last night I had a blast
My jewelery was so white haters put theirs in the trash
Pulled up in some fans just to make them haters mad
Rims with paper tag paper bag full of cash

What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Too many chains on me too many rings on me
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze
What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Dare anybody here to put their hands on me
Too many stacks on me so many racks on me 
Got some killa and some gats and money
What it gonna be
What it aint gonna be
Too many chains on me too many rings on me
Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Making Love To The Money"



[Chorus:]
Makin love to the money
I swear the sex great
I kicked them hoes out
but let the money stay
makin love to the money like a sex tape
I'm talkin kim k I'm talkin Ray J
makin love to the money on the interstate
can't keep my hands off her
we on a dinner date
I'm makin love to my money
shawty keep me str8
I cant live without her
I fuck her everyday

[Verse 1:]
Shawty stay by my side when I started grindin
she the main reason why a nigga shinin
strippers cant see me all this money flyin
30 yrs old talkin bout retirin
I'ma show these hoes who the king of diamonds soon as I walk in the king of diamonds
she broke up wit me once almost had me cryin
she knew that I was cheatin cause she caught me lyin
king of the jungle I'ma lion
white line at the house
we named it Miley Cyrus
she never talk back baby very private
she got me talkin shit but she kinda quiet

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I gotta take her every where
cause these niggas crazy
only leave her by herself
on special occasions
I love makin love cause she so amazing
when I bring her to the club
them hoes be goin crazy
every nigga in the hood
wanna fuck my lady
cant wait for me to slip
so they can take my baby
she get me outta jams
or tight situations
love aint got no cut off point
aint no limitations
she got me in that dice sittin on them thangs
we strikin out them hoes dont look at me the same but fuck it they aint gotta fuck wit me at all
I pick my baby up & took her to the mall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now baby aint no angel
but she a keeper
before she dealt wit me
she dealt wit some real evil people
she bought me ak's call it desert eagles
cocaine hammer pills man its stupid regals
I took her from her ex yeaa he kinda cheap
the very day she left
we started beepin
and she dont ever lie to me
she keep it real
your bitch keep comin short
my bitch keep wearin heels
she keep on standin tall
she never stand me up
she'll go to war wit anybody
she dont give a fuck
she help me keep it in the road
like a hub cap
so I keep her on my mind
like a skull cap

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Gucci Time"
(feat. Swizz Beatz)



I need everybody to report to tha dance floor right now
Tha world is very different now, you know why ITS GUCCI TIME

Big Gucci
Trap boys call me Brick Gucci 
Dime piece time piece got my Swiss movin
Swiss cheese out a hata if he act foolish
Swizz Beats Gucci Mane call it trap music 
I think I need an ESPY the rappers best respect me 
They try to ron Artest me the gone have to arrest me 
With a doubt I bring em out 
The kid is all she think about 
She cheated wit la flare but he didn't spill a drink about her
Do you know what time it is 
Gucci time

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Party Animal"



[Intro]
Yeah....
Wasted....
Party....
Its Gucci....

[Chorus]
Double dueces on the back, 21's on the front
Got the engine in the back, and the trunk is in the front (vroom)
In the back of the club, now I'm smoking on a blunt (wow)
Club packed to capacity, I'm parked right in the front (its Gucci)
From the front to the back, like a zoo (Party Animal) (Wasted)
Wanna ball with me baby, what it do (Party Animal) (Yeaah)
Shes a man eater, baby girls a cannibal (Party Animal) (Party [4x])
I'm a party animal, shes a party animal (Gucci)

[Verse 1]
I'm a party animal, used to be a trafficker
bricks tucked on the bus, call me the road manager (skirt,skirt)
200 thousand cash, I'm might put that in a challenger (wow)
To only ride on moreland, cause thats my east atlanta car (damn)
See first I brought you Juiceman, then I brought you Flocka Flame (yeah)
Gucci Mane the boss mane, but you call call me ice mane (burrr [5x])
My automall's an animal, true religion ??
95 air max, I just bought them from south dekalb
Baby crazy looking at me cause I got a stupid bag (stupid)
Bet mamas a cannibal, know she want a louie bag
I wipe my sweat with gucci rags, blow my nose with stupid stacks
80 for a show so I wipe my ass with 50 racks

[Chorus]
Double dueces on the back, 21's on the front
Got the engine in the back, and the trunk is in the front (vroom)
In the back of the club, now I'm smoking on a blunt (wow)
Club packed to capacity, I'm parked right in the front (its Gucci)
From the front to the back, like a zoo (Party Animal) (Wasted)
Wanna ball with me baby, what it do (Party Animal) (Yeaah)
Shes a man eater, baby girls a cannibal (Party Animal) (Party [4x])
I'm a party animal, shes a party animal (Gucci)

[Verse 2]
I'm riding through the EA, smoking on a Elway
I fuck with them the long way, but I don't ride with passengers
2 seater, road eater, my car is a cannibal
Just ate up the parking lot, car show I'm the champion
Drop my top for Eazy E, Pimp C, B.I.G.
Left Eye, Souja Slim, 2pac, Rest in peace
But I'm a pop a bottle for my niggas doin calendars
Roll a bag of cannibus, they got this shit from Canada
Shawty got her nose up, like she Ms. America
I don't like siddity bitches, I like party animals (Tramp)
Fuck her like a dog, yeah I freak her like a animal
she eat me like a cannibal, she such a party animal

[Chorus]
Double dueces on the back, 21's on the front
Got the engine in the back, and the trunk is in the front (vroom)
In the back of the club, now I'm smoking on a blunt (wow)
Club packed to capacity, I'm parked right in the front (its Gucci)
From the front to the back, like a zoo (Party Animal) (Wasted)
Wanna ball with me baby, what it do (Party Animal) (Yeaah)
Shes a man eater, baby girls a cannibal (Party Animal) (Party [4x])
I'm a party animal, shes a party animal (Gucci)

[Verse 3]
I'm still buying cases, roll it up baby
They poppin pills crazy, whole club faded
Party, party, party, lets all get wasted
Iced out shawty, real retarded ass bracelets
I just wanna ball hard, she just wanna taste it
Lady tryna take dick, baby you will rape this
I'm African-American, my girlfriend is Italian
458 Italia, the engines in the asset

[Chorus]
Double dueces on the back, 21's on the front
Got the engine in the back, and the trunk is in the front (vroom)
In the back of the club, now I'm smoking on a blunt (wow)
Club packed to capacity, I'm parked right in the front (its Gucci)
From the front to the back, like a zoo (Party Animal) (Wasted)
Wanna ball with me baby, what it do (Party Animal) (Yeaah)
Shes a man eater, baby girls a cannibal (Party Animal) (Party [4x])
I'm a party animal, shes a party animal (Gucci)

[Bridge]
Party Party Party, Party, Party, Party [3x]
I'm a Party Animal, Shes a Party Animal

I'm a Party Animal, Shes a Party Animal

(feat. Ray J)



[Intro/Pre-Chorus - Ray J]
Do You Remember When (Remember When....) 
Do You 
Do You Remember When (Remember When....) 

[Chorus - Ray J]
Do You Remember When 
I Met You Girl Everything Was Alllllllright 
Do You Remember when 
We Got A Room We Was Fucking Allllllll Night 
Do You Remember The Time Girl 
Like I Remember The Time Girl 

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
Girl You My Type You Just Right 
That Blouse Fit On You Just Right 
Them Jeans Shes Got On Skin Tight 
Shes Sexy Cool But Still Shy 
I'm Colder Than A Klondike 
Bipolar I Got Dumb Ice 
We Know Each Other We Go Together 
Like Hamburgers And Frech Fries 
Everythings All Right 
Well Never Have A fist Fight 
But Last Night We Had A Sex Fight 
I Told I Had A Blessed Night 
I'm Leaning I'm Meanin 
i Fall Asleep And I'm Dreamin 
Did The Club Bring My Teeth In? 
Last Night I Brang My Queen In 
I Go Get It You Push It 
If I Did It Right Then The Kid Did It??? 
You Hood Critters And You Hood Niggers 
Please Stay Out My Bizness 
From South France To South Philly 
ATL To North Memphis 
From My City To Your City 
You Think You Got More Swag But Not Really 

[Chorus - Ray J]
Do You Remember When 
I Met You Girl Everything Was Alllllllright 
Do You Remember when 
We Got A Room We Was Fucking Allllllll Night 
Do You Remember The Time Girl 
Like I Remember The Time Girl 

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Yo Yo Yo 
I'ma Put It Down So Gucci Mane Go And Cuff So 
Aronics Gonna Hurt But When I'm Gone Its Gonna Make You want More 
Scented Aura Candels I Pull Up In My Lambo 
The Bestest You Never Had Are The Bestest The Man Grow? 
You Had It But You Left So Thats Just The Game Go 
You Cant Get On My Level So Get Off My Land Hoe 
Met A Girl So ?? No Need To Win A Game On 
Reminicising Gucci Everytime They Play The Same Song 
I'm On Like A long John Short Skirt With No Thong On 
Sexy Naked Sunbathing Outside My House With Frames On 
I Took Off Some Busters? And That Boy Ain't Gonna Shit Bout it 
Its Alright We Can Tell That Sucka To Forget About it 

[Chorus - Ray J]
Do You Remember When 
I Met You Girl Everything Was Alllllllright 
Do You Remember when 
We Got A Room We Was Fucking Allllllll Night 
Do You Remember The Time Girl 
Like I Remember The Time Girl 

[Bridge - Ray J]
Girls To My Right Ladies To My Left 
Weathers So Hot Snows On My Chest 
When I See This Fly Girl Tried To Get Her Number 
Then She Tells Me I Already Smashed Last Summer 
Now High Club G5 Planes 
Remember Back Rubs And Pink Champagne 
Now High Club G5 Planes 
Remember Back Rubs And Pink Champagne 

[Chorus - Ray J]
Do You Remember When 
I Met You Girl Everything Was Alllllllright 
Do You Remember when 
We Got A Room We Was Fucking Allllllll Night 
Do You Remember The Time Girl 
Like I Remember The Time Girl 

Do You Remember When (Remember When....) 
Do You 
Do You Remember When (Remember When....)

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Haterade"
(feat. Nicki Minaj, Pharrell)



[Chorus: Pharrell]
We've evolved from small to the tall and shall not stall, been flyin too long
Ooo whoa oh! Ooo whoa oh!
Ooo whoa oh! Ooo whoa oh, girl...
I be sippin on haterade (yup!)
That deep-down, getcha paid (yup!)
And it taste like lemonade (yup!)
Scrunch your face when you sing it babe (yup!)
I be sippin on haterade (yup!)
That deep-down, getcha paid (yup!)
That flavor's lemonade (yup!)
Scrunch your face when you sing it babe, y'knalmtalkinbout?

[Gucci Mane]
I'm not listenin, I'm not interested
My attention only focused on what I get
And I'm glistenin, they call me Mr. Check
White ice lemonade, red ice she thick
Got a general Phantom, bitch I'm icy and peachy
So I treat it real good like hoes is squeezed
My life, I ain't ever seen a car like that
And she prolly won't see the next shit I get
And a seventeen fresh, and I say, "I guess"
Successful, healthy, I live no stress
So today is the day that the big boys shine
Drop tops everywhere, I wouldn't know how to rock
Got the titties of today showin off tan lines
Cash bendin in my pockets, no it's not, draw lines
Me and Skateboard P in the club on time
No not on time, but it's just in time
It's Gucci!

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
[Sighs] Uhh, yo, aiyyo
This one goes out to all of my critics
Don't you feel stupid? Look how I did it
Look how it came to pass when I said it
We can do debit, I don't need no credit
Yes I'm epic, look how I rep it
It's been eight years, but I broke the record
Yup, the record - yup, the record - yup, the record
(And just for the record)
Uhh, I'm all that I can be
And I'll admit, I'm appalled when you envy
Because you can do it too, and you can do it too
I just happen to be the girl that they do it too
So I'ma bounce back, and I'ma ball out
And every time you see me, I'ma go all out
And I'ma win till the endin
Don't be mad when you see me transcendin
Guc!

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I ball hard, I should be in Sports Illustrated
Cooler as a muthafucka in a Porschelemonade coupe
And a Ferrari in your hood, you're intimidated
Mutilated, Maserati Lamborghini decapitated
Fed investigation on what I accumulated
Sayin he ain't real, that I'm not the man that I say I am, like I give a damnmuch
Ride around town pickin up stacks
Some like Louis, some like Gucci
But I love money, yeah I love solution
And my teenage karat ring, baby girl choose
And I ain't really hard to please baby come choose (come choose [echoes])
Lounge around, around the town with the top chopped off
You can call it lost and found 'cause my top stay down
And I ain't seen a muthafucka since I bought this car
I ain't seen a muthafucka since I bought the car
It's Gucci!

[Chorus]

[Pharrell] Gon' lift ya glass, gon' liftya glass
[Gucci] Just think about the future and forget the past
[Pharrell] Everybody just lift ya glass, gon' lift ya glass
[Gucci] If a nigga keep hatin, tell him kiss ya ass
[Pharrell] Just lift ya glass, gon' lift ya glass
[Gucci] Let's think about the future and forget the past
[Pharrell] Everybody just lift ya glass, gon' lift ya glass
[Gucci] That nigga think they goin hard, don't make me laugh - it's Gucci

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"It's Alive"
(feat. Swizz Beatz)



[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, burrr burrr
This is special, GUCCCI
Its Gucci, thats what you mean huh..righht? right..
Ladies and gentleman, showtime

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
My pocket on swole, my rims on chrome
When I hit the club, everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I dont really care
Cuz I ride on em, I style on em
I lean on em, yes, I flash on em
Yeh I know, thats the way you like it, huh, yeh
Thats the way you love me, huh? Its alive..its alive

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's alive, it's alive
Rims cut the eyes
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein
I push weight, but Gucci don't exercise
I get extra from whippin up extra pies
Im in the hood like the mayor round election time
It's a suggestion, don't park your car next to mine
Ima start when the light hit, Im 'posed to shine
Your flow is garbage, they let me out just in time
They got a section, but none of the hoes are fine
They need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by
I run laps around lames with my shoes untied
I jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide
Still stuck outside, that's the ugly side
Looked medusa in the eye and medusa died
This is top secret shit, classified
Don't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind
Can't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time
I got my chain moonwalkin, Michael Jackson time
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind
This bloodline of mine is supposed to shine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Hurry up, hurry up Gucci on the news, they say he walked out the jail rockin stupid jewels
They try and find out what it do, admit it, you confused
Too much cash on me, hundreds fallin out me, true
Big yellow wrists, bright as piss, bitch Im the shit
Big Gucci called Swizz, lets make a hit
2 things in this world I ain't ever seen
Are you a foreigner nigga? I need to help me get me me
Well if your stomach cannot tote it baby, let me breathe
Cuz I dont check if no babe or bitch chasin me
Excuse my French, bitch Im so Gucci, I so fuckin gutter
It dont make no sense to switch for none these mother fuckas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
Somebody said my life is it
I said nah dog, my wife is it
Now I'm back, back on 'em like I never, never left
Plus the boy right here, I'm fresh to death
And the Black Card in my back pocket
The Conaseg lookin' like a speeder rocket
Yeah, I'm zoomin' on the highway
And you should love me, I did it my way

[Hook]

"ODog"
(feat. Wyclef Jean)



[Intro/Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I'm a thuuuuuuuug
Even though I wanna change my life and get it right
To the judge, I'm always gon' be a thuuug
Like O-Dog, "Menace II Society"
They wanna see me undergrooooound
But I just bought a plane, hey, hey
Sky is the limit now; my jet just took off the ground now
And ain't nobody gon' stop my destiny, destiny, no no no
Ladies night - pop a bottle now
Cause the wear just came off now
From doin time in the penitentiaryyyy, yeah
And if you come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion
Let me see you put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)

[Gucci Mane]
{?} beatin on my chick {?} 
Feelin hipper than a hippie in a tye-dye shirt
Gucci Mane motherfucker and the earth my turf
Ice cold, buzz hotter than July 1st
Oooh, this the type of tune make a dime choose
He make it rain then I can make it monsoon
I buy a bitch out her contract, dumb stacks
Suckers sleepin on me Zantax, I'm deadly
I'm talkin Anthrax, the other side of the tracks
You know the Amtrak; multi-millionaire still rockin amulets
I was turnt up to the mess but now I'm past that
But now I'm past that
I move stealth, I'm gettin jealous of myself
Me and Wyclef and the swagger's SoSoDef
Smoke pounds of that 'dro 'dro from out West
And I ain't made at no one cause I'm oh so blessed
It's Gucci

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Tired of all these late nights, smoked out shit
Ain't no mo' leavin the club three or fo' bad chicks
I ain't goin to the lot, coppin no mo' whips
I ain't drinkin, all the pills, I'm all done, I quit
PSYYYYYYCH! I'm poppin wheelies with a dime on the bike
My baby right, she whispered in my ear tonight is the night
I'm higher than a kite, bright ice, in need of a light
Pilot lighter light it homey as I lean to my stripe
Ye ain't freshest out here, ye ain't ballin like me
Baby talk can't comprehend, talkin foreign to more
Purple label, Polo, Revlon on me
I'm the big homey, you a big phony (well damn!)
Makin movies in the V.I.P. I need a Tony
Gucci Mane Tarantino with the tenderonis
Pour 80 bottles in her face, now she dancin on me
She know she dancin with a star them diamonds dancin on me
It's Gucci

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's Gucci

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Dollar Sign"



[Chorus]
I'm so fucking paid I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign

Please man call Obama I wanna buy the dollar sign
Just like first day of school my swag killed em like colombine
The dollar signs my logo and guccis my clothing line
Put on that purple label polo and them hoes say damn he fine
Should be able to keep her so I keep her
Feed her treat her like a diva
My fetish in costa rica cuz she know that I'm a cheater
What up the cost of living
I feel like a trillion bucks
Got beef with a million fuck niggas I dont give a fuck
? on south beach where my house is
Any where on earth my turf but I'm so down south aligator couches
A public service announcement
Gucci so fucking paid pay 2 stacks just for a fade
Bitches surfing on my waves

[Chorus]

By the bar and I own the club
Cant own the bar cuz I'm superstar
I'm so turnt up cant turn me down
Blowing punds thats higher than jupiter
I'm hot turning up lucifer
At club crucial in a stoopid car
Every verse my flow gets stoopider
My producer dont want to produce for ya
? my bank account on steroids
My stash aint got no room for it
New drop head paid cash for it
Ferrari 220 on the dashboard
Long rich nigga wait here his crash course
I pull up to the club in a fast porche
When I leave all the hoes give a sad voice
Got bills to pay and things to do
New hoes to screw and business moves
Imma business man whats the business plan
Used to rip it in the band for the extra grand
I'm successful man hell yes I am
Dead fresh I am bought an extra lamb
And I dont never ask how much it cost
Thats silly cuz I dont really give a damn

[Chorus]

[Gucci - Chorus]

Brand new gucci sandals and she got the bag too..
Yea I got a swag but she got a swag too..

Damn I got a swag but she got a swag too

[Gorilla Zoe]
Brand new pull it out the bag and pop the tag boo..

And everythings new from the shoe to the car.

[Gucci - Chorus]

Weirdo... Weirdo, Imma Weirdo [2x]

Turned into a weirdo 
Mr zone 6, half a million dollar ear lobe 
Weirdo... Weirdo, Ima Weirdo [2x]
Gucci mane, drumma boy 
Dis here for da weirdos 
Smellin like a bag a dro 
Flowin like a weirdo 

[Verse 1]
Shawty Mad, Mad for what 
Mad Cuz she can't get enough 
Tuff luck 
Diggin Gucci Mane and he don't give a fuck 
Throw it up, Pick it up 
Uhh 
She's a material girl 
You aint got enough 
It's a weird, weird... 
And she asking weird questions 
Why yo engine in da rear 
Switch 2 gears then I'm outta here 
Yo boyfriend so last year 
Lets have breakfast on the moon 
Lets have dinner on uranus 
I got Venus on my penus 
And Serena wrapped round my fingers 
Lil mama wet as aquafina 
Stuntin on hoes like Angelina 
Like'em black 
I like em yella 
I like em red 
I like da meat
I'm wishin up somethin jus like da beetles
My buzz spread jus like da measles
Black N white, Tuck sealed, I gamble like Bugsy Segal Gucciiiiiii! 

Weirdo... Weirdo, Ima Weirdo [2x]
Killed da pussy, Drilled da bitch 
Turned into a weirdo 
Mr zone 6, half a million dollar ear lobe 
Weirdo... Weirdo, Ima Weirdo [2x]
Gucci mane, drumma boy 
Dis here for da weirdos 
Smellin like a bag a dro 
Flowin like a weirdo

[Verse 2]
You cock suckin Mosquito 
I own da Carasino 
My girl's got on dem see thru shirts
Short, skirts n Perico
I'm Gucci Tarantino 
My shooterz are Bi-linguel
That's, tall as Valentino
Throw bombs like Dan Marino
I'm gamblin wit her at da Valagio
I'm 40 up at da Casino
I just missed Sosha from Moscow
She say she love my single
Then she bought all of my ringtones
So I said pleasure to meet you
And I ain't gotta talk her ear off
Da freaks was really no need too! 
Women look at me n see what they don't see in you
And I see it too
Geargia Tech raw wit da yellow feet
It's a photo shoot baby so say cheese
Throw money high don't care were it reach
If you offendin you then offendin me
Feelin you, you offendin me
My earings cost like a half a chain weirdooo! 

Weirdo... Weirdo, Ima Weirdo [2x]
Killed da pussy, Drilled da bitch 
Turned into a weirdo 
Mr zone 6, half a million dollar ear lobe 
Weirdo... Weirdo, Ima Weirdo [2x]
Gucci mane, drumma boy 
Dis here for da weirdos 
Smellin like a bag a dro 
Flowin like a weirdo

[Verse 3]
Mad at me suddenly, blammin me it wasn't me
Thinkin his girl studdin me
She's not really studdin me
I ain't really sluttin her
Grammer so screet, Cambleton East Atlanta
Pull up in that yellow thang
I put rims on everythang
Pull up on'em like dranks on me
Black wit da Georgia Tech yellow painted
40, 000 on da feet
Gucci, Drumma Boi and we so unique
Earing cost like a quarter a piece
That's a half a mill each chain Gucci! 

Weirdo... Weirdo, Ima Weirdo [2x]
Killed da pussy, Drilled da bitch 
Turned into a weirdo 
Mr zone 6, half a million dollar ear lobe 
Weirdo... Weirdo, Ima Weirdo [2x]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Beat It Up"
(feat. Trey Songz)



[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's 4 in the mornin
She callin my phone
She wannna be grown
We gone get it on
She said that she lonely
Cause hes never around
Said she like my style
He can lay you down
Say he can lay you down
But I'm a beat it up
I'm a beat it up
I'm a beat it up
He can lay you down
But I'm a beat it up
I'm a beat it up

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I hopped up out my bed
Got my swag on
Stronger than filet mignon
Two Gs blown just for cologne
Money never limited
So Icey with benefits
My driver needs a passport
All my cars are immigrants!
It's so sickening
History you're witnessing
I had a girl she quit me
Now I'm single want to get with me?
Sticky again they stick to me
If you see your chick with GUCCI
Think before you confronting ruley
Ain't my fault your lady choosin
430 stepped on purp it
08 verty rollin dirty
Wardrobe clean as this detergent
Got your girlfriend picking purses
Say she lonely
Gucci only one with to meet me in person
When she met me home
My ***** told me that shes over first

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Your girlfriend keep callin me
I feel like she stalkin me
You at home
And she with me
So morning it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin it
Beatin her down
Straight poundin it
Drillin on your sheets
Got your blanket at the laundromat
Wait baby girl throw it back
Old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane not hardly that
Smack you like I'm mad at that
Swear this sex so passionate
Oral sex she mastered that
Pornographic poses
Like she posing for the internet
Wait I was not finished yet
Never been a minute man
Always been a business man
Gotta catch your feelings man
Got a man?
Oh really now?
Acting like I give a damn!

Used to like her now I don't
Got a real short attention span
GUCCI!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Trey Songz put it on
My shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song
She got on my favorite thong
She so hot
Too hot to touch
Truthfully too much for lames
Gucci mane I'm extra game
So extra rubbers I'm a bring
Got your main thang screaming GUCCI
Every tuesday night we cool whip
Wish we could do it more often
But I'm often somewhere flossin
Lay it down like carpet barbie
Aston martin double park it
Beat it like we got a problem
Pop her till she call me poppa
Freakin partners
Why we never bother with a second option
Hoppin got the mattress poppin
Rockin while her girlfriend watchin
Freakin partners
Why they never bother with a second option
Hoppin got the mattress poppin
Rockin while her girlfriend watchin
Guucci

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"24 Hours"



[Chorus:]
I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stunting on the hoes and I'm shitting on the cowards
Up 24 hours, I'm up 24 hours, I'm up 24 hours
No shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm 24 hours, it's Gucci nigga, it be so hard I'm up 24 hours (Simultaneously). New album, it's Gucci
Cut up something Cory

[Verse:]
Damn it's a good day. Damn it's a good day
Call Drumma boy and told him let's go make a hood tape
First thang I'm a do pull out my 7'4
Candy coated black things sitting on them 40 O's
24 towers, 8 bricks of powder, 10 bells of dro
What I payed for the flour
Don't talk about my lambo, talk about my Rarri
Talk about my Phantom, talk about my Harley
Brick Squad Biker boy, angel named Charlie
Goons going psycho white boy gnarly
Every 24 seconds passing me the Marley
Lames tryna diss don't effect me hardly

[Chorus:]
I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stunting on the hoes and I'm shitting on the cowards
Up 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours
No shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
24 hours. I'm up 24 hours

It's Gucci!

[Verse:]
I'm going to the bank again making a deposit,
It's getting kinda chilly bring my minks up out the closet
Getting kinda warm get my jewerly out the safe
If it be a problem put the hater in his place
I'm slicker than an oil spill
Sharper than a razor
I'm screaming anybody get it like my nigga Major
Finna cop a condo and fill it up with ammo
Brick Squad Bandana on I think I'm fucking Rambo
It's Gucci
I'm a killer so don't push me
Brick Squad ain't no pussy niggas
Running with them wig splittas
Niggas screaming roll one
Gucci let me hold some
But I can't let you hold none
I hit you with the whole drum

[Chorus:]
I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stunting on the hoes and shitting on the cowards
So 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours
No shit, shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours

[Verse:]
I'm fucking with a white girl you can call me Ice-T
Cause I got my crystals on you can call em Spike Lee
Robbin me unlikely last try I drop em
Hollow tip stopped em
I ain't have time to box him
Stunting like an actor
Running like an athlete
Strait to the money like a sprinter at a track meet
First signed Waka, then I signed Gucci
Then I sign Brick Squad tell em come sue me

[Chorus: x2]
I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stunting on the hoes and shitting on the cowards
So 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours
No shit, shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm up 24 hours. I'm up 24 hours

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Mouth Full Of Gold"
(feat. Birdman)



[Gucci Mane:]
Please pardon me but I'm passin gas
To my entourage, no gas masks
I'm in my old school, with the Georgia tag
With my Georgia ass and my red flag
I'm g'd up from the feet up
In my black van wit my feet up
And the blinds down and the beat up
Short bad bitch with the seat up
You know me, from the old me
On Jump street with the straight D
I was low key, at HB
Now I'm 3d, come face me
I went toe to toe with the best of 'em
I bust shots at the rest of 'em
Don't test me, no tester
I rape you, like Chester
I'm a rich ass nigga you bitch ass nigga
You a club pop off ol' snitch ass nigga
Went up to the game Felt symptom of fame
Run up on me put you in a ditch quick nigga
I'm a tell you twice, cause it's Gucci two times
Fuck your clique and fuck your wife
If you got drama nigga, you can meet me outside
Get your head bust wide for your old man's pride

Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold

[Birdman:]
Platinum in my mouth bitch
Shoot you in your face, shit
Uptown gangsta bitch, 100 million dollar shit
All this money ain't shit, livin' how we live it bitch
Redid my grill nigga, Platinum to that gold shit
High price, high life, Do this shit every night
Shoot the dice, pay the price
Priceless when we roll them die
Get it how we get it bitch
Flip that nigga been flippin' them bricks
500 things me and Gucci gonna split that shit
50 in banana clips, twist someone we split your shit
Brand new Ferraris, Bugattis when we shinin bitch
Blood rich gang nigga, we got them rangs nigga
Flippin' them things nigga, ready to bang nigga

[Gucci Mane:]
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold

I put red shoes on my black car
I'm talkin' slick like a rap star
I'm walkin' slick like a trap star
Rich young G with gold teeth
A triple black cat just crossed my path
But it's a four door Jaguar
They put me in this game I put you lames back at the snack bar
I'm black as hell but I'm rich as well
Got 3 dime pieces at the hotel
I'm goin' hard, they blowin' hard
Im strapped up, no body guards
I pull your card, told you disregard
I'm goin' dumb but I'm thinking smart
But if you try my squad I'll hide yo body parts
That's a single shout out to Boulevard
That's single shout out to bank head
Gotta give ya something Lou Cammelton
Cause I pull up in that yella thang
Fat pockets like I just been gamblin'
I put 100 K on my grill shawty
That's the way I feel shawty
Ice cream on my face and Chain
Cause' that's the life I live shawty GUCCI!

Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"This Is What I Do"
(feat. OJ Da Juiceman, Waka Flocka Flame)



[Intro]
Dirty Birds in this motherfucker (ay yeah boyyy) It's Guc'!
Matter of fact it's Big Gucci in this motherfucker (ay yeah)
Flockaveli, Birdman (ay yeah boyyy)
Ca$h Money, Brick Squad linked up to 17 (BRICK SQUAD!!)

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
In the streets, make some moves, get my paper (this is what I do)
FUCK 'EM! Blow croak smoke on my haters (this is what I do)
Pop up with the real, fuck you fakers (this is what I do)
All about my money, fuck you pay me (this is what I do)
Huh? (This is what I do) Oh for real? (This is what I do)
Word? (This is what I do) Bitch! (This is what I do)
Huh? (This is what I do) Oh for real? (This is what I do)
Word? (This is what I do) Bitch! (This is what I do)

[Gucci Mane]
It's Big Gucci (ha) mob moves you wise fools
You can't mute me, my whole life I'm ProTools
First day appeal, just elude me or shoot me
I stand on my word, I'm like Luke in the 90's
Cocaine crazy, 1980 baby
2/12 they birthed me, now find me in Miami
East Atlanta with me, always to the Grammys
This time? Big bucks, no Whammies
My trunk slammin, my track jammin
I'm too fancy; manners I left 'em
I'm healthy, stealthy, and wealthy - you try me?
I'll probably show a nigga how to drive a jet ski
Them Brick Squad niggaz got me like I got me
Me, Flock and Baby back to Bankhead in real Bugatis
Brick Squad, Zone 6, Ca$h Money, whattup?
I might just fuckin buy my mom a Maserati

[Chorus]

[Waka Flocka Flame]
I got 6's on my red and black whip (this is what I do)
Watch them girls choose, iced up like a fool
Po'n lean in my styrogoam, this is how I Screw
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... ha! (Flock 'em!)
Flexin with the crew, mean muggin who?
Bad attitude, what'chu wanna do?
20 bottles, 40 blunts, meet me, on the moon (hold up)
Make it, make it rain, now my lil' bitch strippers come together, fame
Let my, pants hang, watch me, do my, chain swang
Takin, bitch mane, with this yellow, diamond, karat, chain
Waka, Flocka, Flame, Gucci, Gucci, Mane
With the Birdman, this is how we hang

[Chorus]

[OJ Da Juiceman]
(Ayyyy!) This is what I do, then I cut a damn fool
Man I come through Chevrolet, but it look gray Coupe
Get my money stack it up, this is what real players do (yessir)
Now if, he don't get no money then that nigga need to shoot
Smokin kush, at the house, while yo' bitch clean my shoe
Real gangsta nigga mayne, this is what I do
Say lil' potnah just hit me sayin "Man I need a deuce" (okay!)
So I hit him with the force, this is what I do
Killed yo' baby momma; this is what I do (damn!)
Work chipped cell phones, this is what I do
Rims on my car look like man they runnin out they shoe
With that blue 20 piece look like my backyard swimmin pool

[Chorus]

"Reckless"
(feat. Cap, Chill Will)



[Intro]
"Drumma Boy" [echoes]
Ay yeah boyyyy, ay yeah [2X]
(It's Gucci! Unghh)

[Gucci Mane]
Hey girl I'm tearin it up and they knowin that
I had sex so much that I ain't goin back
I blow stack after stack after stack after stack
At the rack everyday and they knowin that
Well I'm blowin that and I'm doin this
And my red flag got the haters pissed
Don't reckless, this not a diss
This not a threat, this real shit
And don't play me, cause ain't no stoppin me
Ain't no toppin me, and ain't no robbin me
Cut the robbers outs, I brought the goons out
We reckless, we O.G.
On Acuras and they textin us
But who gives a fuck and who gives a damn?
I'm blood in and blood out on Flat Shoals with big sand
And Waka Flocka, thanks Flocka Waka
Two times, cause we two crimes
Two bloods and two rides with fo' nines and gang signs
So what's up? The pricety, I'm icey and Icey
I'm the king of diamonds and the princess shinin
And all mine behind me

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
Let's get reckless, let's get reckless

[Cap]
Oh yeah! Cap, I'm in beast mode
Hell yeah I'm on reckless
If you don't like it pussy nigga come check this
Respect this or meet your death wish
There's 17 bird on my necklace
I fuck with dem and they fuck with me
Don't fuck with us, get the fuck from 'round
Cause I like to pop and we sucker free
Reckless, reckless, e'rybody goin HAM
Don't test this, cause if you do
That Smith & Wesson go blam, damn
Look what the fuck done happened
Just cause you heard that a nigga start rappin
That I'm worryin about the {?} pulled out
No toppin, no clappin, clear the whole scene I'm smashin
Bye, gone - boy you better catch up nigga
Get hit from your neck up nigga
Nobody wan' fess up, get your block up
Leave the whole scene full of ketchup nigga
They are wildin, on wildin, on ballin, they violent
I got the little man sydrome, get me in the end zone
Signin autographs who's stylin?

[Chorus]

[Chill Will]
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Vacation in Miami, they say I'm swag surfin
Your girl with ya she ain't lookin but her ass flirtin
See I'm a classy nigga, a thousand dollar curtains
And I just made yo' nigga mad cause his pocket hurtin
And I don't mean I'm jackin off when I say I'm chokin chickens
I mean, when we rap on mo' we call that chokin chickens
I got a talkin code, for all he knows it folds
Too buck to be on probation, too rich to be on parole
My dawgs love me on I'm on the mic talkin reckless
Stuntin, ballin, million dollar flexin
My dawgs love me on I'm on the mic talkin reckless
Stuntin, ballin, millionaire flexin

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"I Don't Love Her"



[Intro: x2]
I love things about her
I love the way she treat me
I love the way she fuck me
I love the way she suck me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a trap-aholic, all I do is ball
Tear the mall down now trick
Don't flag me down. See me down town, 'Rrari
I didn't mean to shit on you. Excuse me, sorry
Verse so slick, make my video marvelous
Polo to the floor. Ralph'd down like Carlton
Try the CEO, they goin' put you on a carton
I didn't mean no harm but my diamonds are dumb, plenty rocks on my arm
Me & Rocko the Don, East Atlanta the Slum
Where I'm from, got a gun, in the club havin fun
And after it's done no more coaches to call it
After party? Bachelor party, they shoulda called it

[Hook: x2]
I love things about her (but I don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (but I don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (but I don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (but I still don't love her)

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Man I love the way she shake it
I like her cause she groovy
Love to see her naked; I love to watch her move it
I like her cause she the coolest
A good head on her shoulders, I love the way she use it
Aye, I like the way she fuck me, love the way she suck me
Love how everytime we play she catch it like rugby
I love she know what's up with me, she love me cause I'm gudda
I like a lot about her; though, but still I don't love her
Still super cool though yeah she my lil buddy
She be sharper than a pencil
Yeah she my lil cuddy
Shawty say I'm dirty but when I see her she wanna hug me
Super swagger charismatic, all my bitches love me

[Hook: x2]
I love things about her (but don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (but don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (but don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (but still don't love her)

[Verse 3: Webbie]
I love how she be swallowin my nut, then she be throwin me up
I like the way she fuck but still I hate when she be blowin me up
All the busters just sweat her, only ballers can get her
She a flipper, I love how she do whatever I tell her
Yeah I like her a lot, but still don't love her at all
I hate pussy ass niggas, and I'm in love with the mall
I got a crush on white diamonds and I got a thang for that kush
That sour diesel my favorite you betta watch how you look
Quick to take ya lil diva and treat that ho like a slut
She was suckin on Gucci, I had my dick in her butt
You know I'm bad bitch crazy, 187's my favorite
Infatuated with money, free Boosie-boo the streets pleading

[Hook: x2]
I love things about her (but don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (but don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (but don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (but still don't love her)

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Better Baby"



[Chorus:]
I know that I need ha
But dont know how to treat ha
But you deserve better baby, better baby, better baby
You deserve better baby, better baby, better baby
Though I wanna keep ha
Be jealous if she leave uh
But you deserve better baby, better baby, better baby
You deserve better baby, better baby, better baby
And I cant hold you back baby

[Verse:]
I really think I love her but
I dont think I know I could
I know I wanna fuck her but
Really thinking if I should
How can I believe her
I dont even believe myself
Tell me how to trust her
I cant even trust myself
And I cant live alone
At the end of the day cant fuck myself
I told her Im confused
And she told me to go fuck myself
Now Im alone in this world
Nothing left but me
But I was born all alone
So I guess thats how its meant to be
But she was sent to me
And I didnt recognize
And I blame it on ma pride
On a fact gon send aside it
Eyes redder than a rose
Heart bluer than a violet
My heart broke and Im heartless
And aint no need to hide it (Gucci)

[Chorus]

[Verse:]
A heart breaking is heart broke
Imma tell the truth cause we grown folks
Why you lookin through ma phone fo
Thats why we ended up none more
You done know me like Chan Doe
Done left me up in my condo
Looking for you like Wardo
My nose open like Gunzo
I think I love her I dont know
I like her alot but she loco
She crazy, swagged up,
I try to hug her she want more
In and out ah town all the time
She in and out ma mind all the time
I cant lie baby girl stupid fine
But Im out the tush got that stupid grind
She loves me now or she loves me not
Treat me cold no she treat me hot
Caramel but not apricot
Got one chance wont miss the shot
I know she special yeah alot
I know someone might take ma spot
Cant lie it may hurt alot
But uh she need a man or not (Its Gucci)

[Chorus]

"Brinks"
(feat. Master P)



[Intro: Master P (Gucci Mane)]
Ungghhhhh... Gucci!
(Big Gucci) It's yo' time
I'ma give you the blueprint
Ain't nobody harder
We got money in the matress, old money
I got credit cards, Gucci got cash money

[Gucci Mane]
It's the billion kid, Gucci, we went half on a bank
I'm a walkin {?} happenin, I live in a tank
He go hard in the paint, he got hard at the bank
Waka Flocka, Gucci Mane, I'm goin hard on the drinks
And I get pussy every day, I guess you is what you drank
Cause y'all pussycat is bigger than the diamonds in my rang
Who is I? {?} done run off with the scrubs
Duck or neck, but you didn't share the love with the thugs
And the rap game paralyze the street life, I'm not sellin drugs
I'm, selling CD's globally, my Brinks truck pullin up
I get offers for a million dollars just to throw it up
I made two thundred thousand today I feel like throwin up
Gucci

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got Hummer trucks, pullin up, but I'm buyin other trucks
Master P and Gucci Mane done pulled up in the wealth with our
Brinks... we threw our rap in the rink
Chop Squadron pullin up, drophead pullin up
Drop dead, I don't skate, froze up, we pullin up
Brinks... we threw our rap in the rink
Up, the {?} bad nigga, Brinks

[Master P]
I'm 'bout to pull a Mike Vick on 'em dude
Get money, street boys; I love the kid
Iced green Peedy, I got the streets heated
I left a minute now I'm back the game really needs me
Gucci Mane called me, man I got that flipper
Everybody come and tryin to get in my hair for dipper
With that dola, trap boy, granolas
Brick Squad soldiers, gon' run 'til it's over
I had chills for a minute, still screamin No Limit
Had changed my life, dem fools thought I wasn't in it
Drumma B and we winnin; and y'all never done it
Tried to play the game but none of y'all never won it
Don't need to be replaced - I'm already a legend
From the streets to the hood to my little brother up in heaven
I'm a ghetto star

[Chorus]

(feat. Wale)



[Intro]
["Listen to the track BITCH!" echoes]
Ay yeah girl... ay yeah [4X]
(Brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr) Gucci (brr-brr!)

[Chorus 2X: Gucci Mane]
The pretty bitches love me, them bitches love me [2X]
I think them bitches love that I'm a bottle popper [2X]

[Gucci Mane]
She caught up in my love triangle
I used to sell them things in triangles
And that was when I was in the eighth grade
Now I'm self made; and I'm high paid
Nigga you ain't even in my tax bracket
I'm pulling Gucci denim off the clothes racket
Gucci man, it's the Gucci crew
Brick Squad rappers, nigga who are you?
What it do nigga? What's poppin?
By them 30 next summer we droppin
We back again, yeah we back again
And we gotta win, she wanna be my friend

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I pull up in that black and red Challenger
A com-pe-tition, where the challengers?!
I pull up in that 'Rari with them other ones
And thinkin 'bout it, I'm goin and gettin another one
Gucci Mane I run the land from Africa to Pakistan
Understand and overstand, Gucci Mane in Overland
What a fine ass yellow bonnnnnnnnnne
She got it goin on
Now I got so many chains on they don't know what's goin on
Find your number in my phone and don't know what be goin wrong
Find the number in my phone and don't know what be goin wronnnng
She had it goin on

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Brr, brr, ay, lemme see, okay
A-T-L they know my name, Magic City throw some change
Flyest nigga in this bitch, and I don't even own no chain
Take yo' chick, with no complaints, she say my shit oh so great
And that's why she been feelin me.. and y'all got that novocaine
Go for mine, that ball shit, forced to rock 'til I'm nauseous
Stuck up when, she sober when, she rollin got no conscience
She OD's on Louboutin, she work at that nudie bar
Told her do it for the money, get your camera nudin on
Green we can all burn, 'til I am the highest man
Y'all a bunch of pussies, why the fuck y'all near the lion's den?
Paper planes, pilotin, Wale so attirin
Wale nekkid beatin gals you'd think I know Esiason
Burrrr!

[Chorus]

"Pancakes"
(feat. 8Ball, Waka Flocka Flame)



[Intro]
Yahhhhhhh, it's Gucci!
Birds, go!
Birds, it's Dirty, Birds
It's Gucci

[Gucci Mane]
I'm an East Atlanta rider
You gon' fuck around and get ya whole clique tied up
My brain fried; I'm on the skull of the Impala
I'm high on kush, it's 'bout my money mixed with power
So keep it brief
Nigga, two hundred thousand in the fleece
Pistols, two hundred twenty on the dash
System, I pull off it look like a flash
Picture, cheeeeeese!
I got the 24's, those 74 for 2's
When you was on the stage, Gucci was on the news
But bitch don't pity me, I look like Mr. T
I pimp like Soulja Slim, but I think I'm Eazy-E
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Patty cake, patty cake, I hop around with pancakes
I touched down with hash browns and serve 'em with the pancakes
Patty cake, patty cake, I hop around with pancakes
Got flapjacks, hash browns and syrup in my crack space
Patty cake, patty cake, I hop around with pancakes
I touched down with hash browns and serve 'em with the pancakes
Patty cake, patty cake, I serve you niggaz pancakes
Flapjacks, hash browns and syrup in my crack space
It's Gucci

[Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm the young nigga all the old head love dawg (FLOCKA!)
I ain't lettin shit slide, this ain't baseball (BRICK SQUAAAD!)
Banned in 45 states cause I'm too real
Waka Flocka like a Gucci album, I'm hard to kill
I don't think they fuckin with me whether I'm locked dead or in jail
I'm from Clayon County, Riverdale so I'm supposed to give 'em hell
I'm aware the grass got snakes, I'm aware they gon' hate
You too late, I'll be damned you take this dinner off our plate
Dirty Birds, Dirty Birds, twenty-one gun salute and got killed
It's Bankhead Brick Squad out in U.K., these niggaz ain't fuckin with me
Mob up off that run day, SK's, AK's
Throwaways I let that triple up like {?} triple beam we crackin

[Chorus]

[8Ball]
Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka and ya boy big Ball
Hard from the start; I ain't never been no fuckin lame
Here I go with Waka Flocka, here I go with Gucci Mane
One of a kind - that Memphis 10 runnin through my bloodstream
Ghetto superstar - man them hood bitches love me
Cup full of that ol' purple drank, pullin on some of that stanky dank
Pocket full of Benny Frank and bitch, what the fuck you thank?
45 hollowheads in my stout, yellow purt{?}
I hope one of these ol' bitch bitch-ass niggaz don't cross that line and get hurt
Money what we came to get, money what we represent
You ain't talkin 'bout shit if you ain't talkin 'bout gettin it
Hard hustle never fold, forever I will be cold
Forever I will be big Ball, mouth full of gold

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Hell Yeah"
(feat. Slim Dunkin)



[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
A hundred bales of that mid shit; hell yeah
This that shit that get your kids rich; hell yeah
Hundred bags of that kush shit; hell yeah
This that President Bush shit; hell yeah

[Gucci Mane]
This that arm on my kush shit
My girlfriend think she President Bush bitch; hell yeah
And I'm gone off that lean shit
My brother Duke keep on sendin me that green shit; fuck jail!
Gucci time, and I'm hood rich
I'm in that Zone 6, I throw it like the first pitch
My yellow 'Rari in the front and I parked it
A black chick in some heels match the carpet
I'm pullin up to the club like I own it
Ain't with that bullshit, Gucci don't condone it
My tolerance get low with the flexin
I woke up, bought my main chick a Lexus

[Chorus]

[Slim Dunkin]
I be the Brick Squad young'un, leave you stankin like a Funion
All these other rap niggaz toed like a bunion
I'm B.S. and you BS, but I'm Brick Squad and you bullshit
Pistol like my chaperone, we goin on a school trip
Places that you never seen, blowin on that stupid green
Rollin on the stupid beam, hit the scene in limousine
Codeine, promethazine, diamonds in my pinky ring
Nigga what da fuck you mean? Brick Squad, dream team
I got (Money to Blow), naw I ain't Drizzy
Money make the world go 'round, that's why I'm dizzy
Standin behind Guc' and Flock, they like who is he?
Slim Dunkin in this muh'fucker; cut the chizzy

[Gucci Mane]
It's Big Gucci, excuse me while I ball
Until my release my nigga no lights out
Lights out, creep on in silence
Why do, I, pull more violence
We non-violent, while my tattoos smilin
To remind me, of the time they robbed me
With no problems, now my problems solved
And it's revolvin around all these guns yeah
And my condo, stretch from here to Compton
to Bouldercrest, Roberta who the same function{?}
That's somethin, to those who have nothin
No bluffin, Brick Squad no cuffin
It's Gucci!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh

"My Year"



[Intro]
It's my year, it's my year
And look at my chain, my watch and my ear
It's my year, it's my year
My engine in the rear, because it's my year
It's my year, it's my year
Just look at my chain, my watch and my ear
And look at my gear, and look at my gear
My engine in the rear, because it's my year

[Chorus]
It's my year, it's my year
And look at my chain, my watch and my ear
It's my year, it's my year
My engine in the rear, because it's my year
It's my year, it's my year
I do it on the strength, how I be the pimp
It's my year, it's my year
My engine in the rear, Drumma Boy
It's my year

It's me, not you
I don't want you no mo'
I swear, I don't care
I'm turnt up, I'm burnt up
And turned out, and you're not
And I am, the Gucci Mane
Don't get it be like dammmmn, stop
They know who I ammmm, hot
I'm icy as a fool
I knowwww, I knowwww, very well, very well

Bottle drunk I don't sailor
And I stay, tailored
And I keep tippin waiters

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Trick Or Treat"
(feat. Slim Dunkin, Wooh The Kid & Waka Flocka)



[Intro]
[car peeling out] [car revs then peels out]
("Listen to the track bitch!") It's Gucci
Funky feet (funky feet) funky feet
Pull up with that stupid beat, orange Camaro trick or treat
Stupid geek (tweakin) it's super street
It's a Super Sport nigga, trick or treat

[Gucci Mane]
I flee the broads, stars and cars look like they just broke in the mall
Home girl seen my auto mall and said let's go and have a ball
Hold applause change your drawers, Big Gucci not Santa Clause
Young'uns might just break the law, whole Squad be like "Damn the law"
If what you seen ain't what you saw, Scary Movie, Saw 3
East Atlanta, whassup Santa, Alabama ride with me
Glock nine on me, hot rod lonely
Gucci ridin double wides, tractor-trailers, ponies
What'chu mean? Bag of beans, same boy from the magazines
Two AK's three magazines, make a stupid horror scene
Orange Ferrari, purple trees, whippin like on gold D's
Pimpin like I'm Goldie, listenin to the oldies
It's Gucci!

[Chorus]
Funky feet (funky feet) funky feet
Pull up with that stupid beat, orange Camaro trick or treat
Stupid geek... it's super street
It's a Super Sport nigga, trick or treat
Look at me, nigga look at me
Pull up in my new Ferrari, pull up and say trick or treat
And after a week, I cop another skreet
A pretty car, nigga, trick or treat

[Wooh Da Kid]
Okay our whip, our feet, ridin down our street
But got the broma{?}er'y T, turn your wife into a freak
Snatch the mighty iron whip, I gotta eat nigga
You lookin sweet nigga {click clack} trick or treat nigga
Trunk on thunder, candy paint mumble
Why your tint so dark? Bitch I'm ridin under
This Brick Squad, nigga what it do
Ye ain't Brick Squad pussy nigga who is you?
Money over e'rythang, even you
If the General call then you better shoot
BLAK BLAK BLAK BLAK BLAK, you know the dump
Wooh Da Kid and Guc' truth gon' pop the trunk

[Chorus]

[Slum Dunkin]
Louis Vuitton, come take a flick
You ain't takin shit, but you can take a click
It's a nightmare when I pop up
Got the top cut wit'cho lady chick
We super geeked, I'm hella high
Her mouth wet but mine stupid dry
I'm movin slow like a zombie
while she woppin me, she boppin me
Got black ice, call me Black Ice, really heavy around my neck
I just blackout, call me Blackout, look and shot at a nigga that flex
Now I'm bustin at him, I'm gunnin at him
He runnin real quick with those funky feet
He dead man, I'm toe taggin
I'm a black bag him in white sheets
I'm a flatline him, it's over with
And he ain't comin back, no heartbeat (ADIOS!)
Brick Squad some rude boys
Don't play around, don't fuck with them
I pull up on your block
Let some shots off, you stuck with them
I'm a G-A, N-G, S-T, A

[Chorus]

[Waka Flocka Flame]
All these {?} girls call me wantin to fuck
And Monique {?} the old ladies wanna fuck me
I poke you to death like Chucky
Came up in one year they say I'm lucky, FLOCKA!
Semi little hussy {?} that's a get money getter
All my girls got Waka Flocka on they {?}
Don't need a school girl, need a down-ass slut
Ten pack of bills I wanna roll and bite
Fuck police, fuck police, no license on me
In the club V.I.P. no ID cuz got funky feet
Ten left, twenty right, dead guys on me
I'm on E, it's Olde E, I think I'm 'bout to O.D.
Some fly girls wanna swat me
And it's gettin out of hand like I lost my arm
Off the chain like I lost my job
Hold my lotto ticket, girls love my charm
Ballin like pimps, shit doesn't switch
{?} ill, they love my sign
And I think I'm James Brown I got funky feet
Say Flock can't rap, I don't motherfuckin care
FLOCKA!

[Chorus]

"Tragedy"



[Gucci Mane:]
Lord knows I don't wanna be
In the penitentiary
But that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy
I be right back smoking weed
Chilling with the family
Cause that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy

Starting out my week with a quarter boat
Stupid strong and I won't sell a quarter O
I got 5 on that cause I'm infamous
Fuck fame, strippers love me...

"Back to work nigga! I know y'all niggas miss this shit!"

Y'all know I don't wanna be
In a penitentiary
But that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy
I be right back smoking weed
Chilling with the family
Cause that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy

Starting out my week with a quarter boat
Stupid strong and I won't sell a quarter O
I got 5-0 mad cause I'm infamous
Fuck fame, strippers love me ask Infamous
Fuck no, I ain't working for the minimum
I'm going in, every weekend is a cinema
So get a Coke, hot dog and some candy bars
I'm from the 6 but my dick dunn been in movie stars
I'm so high right now I want to buy the bar
Let everybody in free
I'm bringing all my cars
And I don't wanna be locked up, hell no!
But we got weight so really wanna sell dope

Y'all know I don't wanna be
In a penitentiary
But that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy
I be right back smoking weed
Chilling with the family
Cause that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy

Excuse me for being gangsta, I'm crazy
I couldn't have been a sissy
Mama wouldn't have fed me
I'm all-red and my Beemer confetti
I'm reminiscing 18 with the Chevy
I'm deadlift with a tool like Freddy
Not Jackson, Kruger, you smell me?
And no push ups, just kush up
No lay-ups, just caked up
E A G A got bakers
Eastside, can I roll through Decatur
I'm going hard for the squad
I'm the major
Anything move here, Gucci paper

"Hard On A Bitch"
(feat. Chill Will)



[Gucci Mane:]
I'm Gucci Mane and I'm so player
And when I grab her hair, baby scream "oh yeah"
Triple ice on so they gon' stare
I like it when they wear the dress without the underwear
I'm swingin' through the club like I don't care
I'm a million dollar figure, nowadays that's rare
And you ain't gotta talk boo, I ain't finna stalk you
Girl, I get like fifty thousand dollars just to walk through
All this stuntin', I'm so blunted
What I'm gon' do with all this money?
Bag it up, wrap it up, trash bag money
Hundred pounds, ninety-three, octane money

I go hard on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man
I'm so smart on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man

Baby, it's my watch that got everybody watchin'
Them white BBS's on the bracelet got 'em talkin'
Perfected on my life, thirty years of stress
A million dollar statue as a token of success
So practice makes perfect, I'm on side turfin'
While you internet surfin' and buyin' hoes purses
I'm so hard on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man
I'm so smart on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man
I just fuck her, throw her chump change and it's to the next thang
I go from the jump, man, but you bitches know I...

I go hard on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man
I'm so smart on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man

[Chill Will:]
I'm feelin' my homie Game, I got money, I got fame
Wanna hear some more? I got pool, I got range
Bitches wet they clothes when I step up in the door
But I treat these monkey hoes like some garbage on the floor
I know I be fly like the man on the moon
You standin' in my space, baby let me get some room
Take a step back let me see what you look like
Dig you, I might, only if you weigh
I'm so smart on these hoes, man games I be playin'
I go hard on these hoes let that lame hold your hand
She say she wanna love me, I won't let her rub me
Dick up in her mouth, that's the only way she touch me

[Gucci Mane:]
I go hard on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man
I'm so smart on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man

"Camera Ready"



Crazy Mane, with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?

HOLIDAY SEASON!

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
[?] ain't a thang, call me Gucci Mane
I got these bitches taking pictures of my candy chain
I'm just a rich, wealthy nigga, kind of weird and strange
But I stay dead fly like a private plane
If you don't know about the ki, then I must explain
Everything that I got, owe it to cocaine
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussein
I'm fire: propane, I'm a boiling flame
I came, I conquered, I did my thang
Dropped my chain, then I changed the game
Two dames on the train, got that English brain
Cause my money real long like a modern train

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Gucci Guwop up in the drop playing 2Pac
Taking 2 shots of Ciroc, then drop some [?]
Taking some blocks off the top, I gotta rerock
42 grams in my pants, now that's a Teton
The hustler don't stop on my block
They sell sheet rock
Keeping score, deadin your ass and tell you kick rocks
Gram after gram, yes I am, I got a weak spot
Last couple days, I got high as a teapot
Way to make bills off the deal, I got the [?]
Niggas got mills on the deal, I pulled the cigar
Half of a bill off this shit, then I'm a nigga
Count all my money with my chain, then we gon get out

[Hook]
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane]
It's the crazy Mane with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
I dunn camouflaged the flow so it's pure ?
Got a deal for the labor, so it's more to gain
I am so untame, y'all niggas are lame
Treat your bitches like a whore, treat em all the same
You gon take her to the store, by the bitch a ring
She gon beg me for some more, want a catchy drank
60 grand in my pocket, that's a drop-top Stang
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?
I'mma shave it off the top, get some extra caine
If you ain't getting money, you should be ashamed!

Lil' mama cold supa cold she got me screaming brrr

From her nails to her toes she got me screaming brrr
Yeah she got me screaming brrr yea she got me screaming brrr
We at the mall buying clothes she got me screaming brrr
Soon as I seen her I chose she got me screaming brrr
Gucci bag which she tote she got me screaming brrr
Yeah she got me screaming brrr she so cold I'm screaming brrr

Shorty bad with the bag she got me screaming brrr
Bought to kill me with the swag
The way she walk I just cannot stop looking at her ass
Her [?] painted on her plus she killed them with the bag
Yea she killed them with the bag
Baby cold c-c-cold
Her dad must be an eskimo cause damn shorty froze
She know she hot so she don't really fuck with them hoes
But if they bag on her then she fuck with the hoes
See what's up with them hoes
Its Gucci Mane in this bitch
Pink diamonds on my Braclet look like nuva on my wrist
Big ice big [?] so I keep a new hoe on my dick
Big car big crib I keep a few hoes on this dick
Shorty know that she the shit

Lil' mama cold supa cold she got me screaming brrr
She going in on them hoes she got me screaming brrr
From her nails to her toes she got me screaming brrr
Yeah she got me screaming brrr yea she got me screaming brrr
We at the mall buying clothes she got me screaming brrr
Soon as I seen her I chose she got me screaming brrr
Gucci bag which she tote she got me screaming brrr
Yeah she got me screaming brrr she so cold I'm screaming brrr

Shorty got me screaming brrr
Tell her what she wanna hear
Tell it to her crystal clear
Like the solitaries off in my ear
She stupid bad and supa cold
Sub zero her fingers froze
Manicure pedicure on her toes
Give me a chill like the wind just blow
And she got me tricking out
Coming off prada into louie
Every time I break her off
Beat it till she screaming gucci
His her fur his her clothes
I pull up in the GT she pull up in the spur
All in dc pulling on her hair
Ride off in the Lambo, engine in the rear
Baby amazing just go crazy
Sex so good make a nigga impatient
Take a vacation
[?]
Catch her at the mall catch her at the station
Catch her at the ball catch her at the atrium
Catch her [?] catch her in decatur
Bet you can't catch her nigga with no paper

Lil' mama cold supa cold she got me screaming brrr
She going in on them hoes she got me screaming brrr
From her nails to her toes she got me screaming brrr

We at the mall buying clothes she got me screaming brrr
Soon as I seen her I chose she got me screaming brrr
Gucci bag which she tote she got me screaming brrr
Yeah she got me screaming brrr she so cold I'm screaming brrr

"Tax Free"



Holiday Season! Ay!

Tax free, tax free
You get your income tax back, call me
I got dope nigga, you better call me
I need all mine
All tax free
I beat the dope up
Like a step-child
Yeah, the dope's stepped on
Like a step-child
Take a step back
Off the reptile
Yellow crocodile with a gold smile
I move the dope twice, like a kindergartner
Big bag of collard greens
Like I'm the gardener
That Drumma Boy on the track
Run and tell em that
Give this to DJ Drama, tell him
I say run it back
Don't try running off on me
Cause I'mma get you back
You know EA, don't know how to act
I'm taking hits, I"m talking shit
I coach the Squad, I make em blitz

I robbed the connect and ain't been broke since
It's the return of Mr. Zone 6
I'm talking shit. Cash shit
I got them bricks
It's the return of Mr. Zone 6, I hit a lick

Tax me? Tax me? Nigga
You can't tax me, I get it dirt cheap
Tax me? Tax me? Nigga
You can't tax me, I get it dirt cheap
You know me, shipping OG
I know the middleman, but he don't know me
Trophies in my car garage
I brought? for all my fuckin entourage
That murder charge? I beat that!
That pistol charge? I defeat that
Assult with poolstick
Say I commit that
They label me "convict" I don't accept that
Step back like a step-child
The dope's stepped on
My hood the X Files

I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty
Like fuck the party, Iced out shawty, shawty
I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty
I'm smokin' Marley, don't tell nobody shawty
I'm walkin' through the airport smelling' like
Everyday I'm to the mall rein' up Versace
I got a Rari, I want a brand new, Bugatti
30 carrot ring bling, bitch I'm Liberace
If I shitted on you hurt your feelings damn I'm sorry
I didn't mean it, don't be salty, I didn't mean to buy it
I'm gambling hundred grand a game bitch I'm goin' Scotty
Its Gucci Mane, Ice cream Man, bitch I'm bout it bout it

I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty
I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty

You ain't tricking' if you got it so I pay these hoes for pleasing' me
These freak hoes ain't deceiving me, I fuck these slut hoes easily
I'm a rap star, I'm a trap star, my earrings cost a Acura
These freak hoes suck like Dracula
Like Scotty I don't get to attest to her
I'm a bachelor, you a wrestler, I flip these hoes like spatulas
My jewelry game spectacular, it really ain't no more challengers
For Scotty mane, get naughty mane
Shoot that bitch up like Gotti mane
Y'all suckers not in my lane, I'm riding in a big body mane
Smokin' cali Dro with a Irish hoe
On a private plane with Waka flame
Sippin' champagne my campaign so turnt up its a damn shame
I'm off the hook and off the wall off the throttle and off the chain
Bitch you off or on cause I'm tonight
I got cocaine come catch a drank

I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty
I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty
50 grand in every pocket, I'm goin' Scotty
I'm bout to buy a new Ferrari, I'm goin' Scotty

I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty
50 grand in every pocket, I'm goin' Scotty
I'm bout to buy a new Ferrari, I'm goin' Scotty

I feel like I'm a movie star, everyday buying a new car
Go get a Tec then I get some rims, Oh I gotta get me 2 of them, matter of fact gotta get me like 4 of them
One for my bitch like hers and him
Iced out slim with the diamond gems
Iced out slim with the tilted brim
I don't see nobody, bitch I'm goin' Scotty
Bitches say they love, but really they love my money
Dirty birds like Roddy, ride off in my Audi
I don't see nobody, shittin' on niggas no potty
More cars then a car lot, don't mistake me for car thief
What I'm a bring out this summer
Bitch wanna come take a sneak peak
All white guts I'm a neat freak, pussy ass nigga you a cheapskate
All this cash that my clickbait, bitch think that we won a sweepstakes

I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty
I'm goin' Scotty, I'm goin' Scotty, Scotty
50 grand in every pocket, I'm goin' Scotty
I'm bout to buy a new Ferrari, I'm goin' Scotty

"Play Your Cards"
(feat. YC)



Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

I'm on my hustle, I'm bout my grind
I got a plan to make the whole Atlanta mine
One for the money, two for the show
Three dollars for the soda, I mix it in the coke
I'm icy in the summer, I think I need a coat (burr)
I'll drag you to the river then throw you off the boat
Cold dirty shame, low down dirty games, I use to have them thangs
But now I'm on the screen
Play it how it go, take it how it come
Fuck how you feel cause my feelings numb
Play it how it go, take it how it come
Fuck how you feel cause my feelings numb

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

Gucci mane I'm hard to kill
Ain't nobody murkin me
Niggas think they hercules, have they ass in surgery
Manical, see all these purses, ain't nobody hard as me
He may have more money but he'll neva have more heart than me
Its big dog, bulldog, leapfrog, jumpoff
Sawed off pump, nigga this ain't what you want
And we goin all out, all out for the yola
I owe it to the soda
I cut the music down just so I can hear the motor
I open up the sun roof so you can smell the odor
Play your cards right or they'll find you in Dakota
Suckers get trampled, snitches ran over, snitches ran over

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt

"Guilty"
(feat. Young Buck)



[Intro:]
Holiday season!

Ricky Racks I See You!

[Gucci Mane:]
If being filthy rich is a crime
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I killed the rap and last night
I pleaded self-defense
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I guess I'm guilty bitch

These suckas talking nonsense
I killed your homeboy
Cause I don't have a conscience
I'm strapped like Bronson
Brick Squad, Trap House, beat bunking
I'm wild like Tarzan
I'm swinging through the Zone 6
In Ferraris. It's on again
I go to win, strap-for-strap
I go rap for rap, I rep the trap
Refuse the death but game to slap
My phone is tapped
I'm off the wall and off the scale
Came out of jail like
A bat out of hell
I refuse to pay up, gotta salute the myth
Got Clientele, I might as well
I'm moving weight from state-to-state
I gots to get my aconchelet [?]
I know the feds be watching me
But there ain't no way they stopping me

If being filthy rich is a crime
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I killed the rap and last night
I pleaded self-defense
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I guess I'm guilty bitch

[Young Buck:]
Drop a pack off to my lawyer
Take these charges, overturn em
Roll the kush in my trial papers
And burn em - I'm not going
The fork in it and my Glock showing
If it don't shine then it's not glowing
Ain't mine if it's not foreign
Broke ho - bitch you not knowing!
They was rap touring I was behind the bus
With packs for em
Didn't plan on digging this up
But I need a shovel
Good looking, Gucci got me back
I'm trying to buy another
Pounds of mid and my college bitch's
House neighbors complaining about the smell
They got her kicked out
They popping down to the last pill
In Cashville
I'm getting it fast still, on the real
I feel it

"Two Dope Boys"
(feat. Chill Will)



All I need is one mic all I need is one stove
Homie got a nice flow but gucci got that white coke
You ain't gettin the right dope, you knockin on the wrong door
Last nigga tried me let's just callem john doe
And since you short a dime homie then park me a old school
I fronted you, you ran off that's not what you're supposed to do
I'm gettin my tip fade cut pour the chris and flat show
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm bristol
Yeaaaaa
Gucci mans a live watt
Try me like I'm yung berg and I'm a make yo eyes cry
Gucci like to drank and gucci like to smoke
And gucci on a rise while ya'll niggas goin broke
GUCCI! gucci mans a g, tell me sumthin I don't know
I got court in early mornin I don't really wanna go
I do this for the people cause I'm my brothers keeper
I don't fear you cause I'm parrapalegic, wheres my parralegal

See that house right there yea make a lot a money
Whos that knockin at the door
Probably a couple junkies
That coop ova there yea cost a couple hundreds
See my neighborhood is buckin tell my blood to keep it comin
Dopeboys, dopeboys with the dopeboys
Dopeboys, dopeboys with the dopeboys
What you wanna get homie hurry up and buy it
Dopeboys gone buy you gone get yo self supply

I'm in my M6 beemer
This is no 645
Like a pigeon in the sky, I just shitted on your ride
So much weight off in my house, you would think it was a gym
Plus my nikes match my necklace and my necklace match my rims
I got court in early mornin I don't really wana go
Say I violated probation just because I blew my nose

Blew 300 on my rolce
200 more on the lamb
Million dollars on the crib
Car note, don't know what that is
Gucci, you don't know who that is
Mama that's just gucci man that my boy that's my partna
I'm gucci man biggest fan
Plus she don't know what that is
I'm with that I don't give a damn
If you think I give a fuck you must do not know who I am, gucci

See that house right there yea make a lot a money
Whos that knockin at the door
Probably a couple junkies
That coop ova there yea cost a couple hundreds
See my neighborhood is buckin tell my blood to keep it comin
Dopeboys, dopeboys with the dopeboys
Dopeboys, dopeboys with the dopeboys
What you wanna get homie hurry up and buy it
Dopeboys gone buy you gone get yo self supply

Mirror Mirror mirror
Whos the realest in the game
Why you ask that stupid question
Boy you know that's gucci mane
East atlanta 6
You know how we roll
I just bought anotha chevy got it right back out the bowl
Tall stacks up in my closet I can't even see my clothes
And my belly get so big I can hardly see my toes
Got a car in my garage I have never ever drove
It's a door black on black phantom I call that bitch dorrough
If she going to the ladies room I guess I'll let her know
I got powder in my living room, so she don't have to stroll
A year ago today, I was sitting in my cell
Where you see yoself in 5 years
A so icey billionare
Gucci

See that house right there yea make a lot a money
Whos that knockin at the door
Probably a couple junkies
That coop ova there yea cost a couple hundreds
See my neighborhood is buckin tell my blood to keep it comin

I got this party started, ready for the mike like a starving artist
And I'm hard to start it

I'm a mad man, ask yelawolf I need a straight jacket

So I gave her just what Gucci mane tried to get you to take

(That white girl is a freak)
I pass that bitch to yell, he pass that back to me

I'm too turnt up that I'm turnt out
I'm so burnt up, my lungs burnt out
I smoke too much, my crew smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out
I'm too turnt up that I'm turnt out
I burn too much, my crew burnt out
I smoke too much, my roof smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out

Elevator kush got me leaning like the Eiffel tower
I'm dreaming of a plate of powder
These pills got me tripping, I'm tripping
I missed my prescription, I'm slippin'
I'm a mad man, ask yelawolf I need a straight jacket
But I'm balling out and you ain't in my task bracket
7 is the key, that white girl is a freak, I pass that bitch to yela', he pass that back to me

I came in with Irene, I'm leaving with Codeine
I need to take a chill pill and retreat from the scene
But I'ma take a stand until my drugs here, you dig
I purchase them to use em so guess what Gucci mane did...

I'm too turnt up that I'm turnt out
I'm so burnt up, my lungs burnt out
I smoke too much, my crew smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out
I'm too turnt up that I'm turnt out
I burn too much, my crew burnt out
I smoke too much, my roof smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out

Yeah, everyday I'm throwin back
I guess I'm more like my dad than I thought I was
And I need more in fact
I run to the store like I had a job moppin up
Another party popping up, drink till I drop my cup
Sink gettin all stopped up
From the blunt guts, smokers on the porch
With the bong full of bud And the kegs pumped up
Yeah that's right, cocaine got these boys scratching they head like a head of lice
Bad luck on the floor with a bitch when I thought I had a hit, but instead it was a dike
So I gave her just what Gucci mane tried to get you to take
Soon as it set in, she came in with a twin and let off the breaks
I got this party started, ready for the mike like a starving artist
And I'm hard to start it, when its all said and done, and the confetti runs out then you can just point the party at me...
Yeah that, yeah that's me
Yeah that's daddy's pedigree
Drop a mothafukin verse readily, ain't none of them ahead of me
Yeah catfish billy, shoulda just called me "cept fo three"
Cuse I take a thirty two pack of brew and crush em... except for 3
Save them for the light weights, the 115's in the skinny jeans
And I'll be the king of the scene, the scene with the jim beam, beam

I'm too turnt up that I'm turnt out
I'm so burnt up, my lungs burnt out
I smoke too much, my crew smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out
I'm too turnt up that I'm turnt out
I burn too much, my crew burnt out
I smoke too much, my roof smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out

"MAjor"
(feat. Wooh Da Kid)



[Gucci Mane:]
I stay fresh everyday, like a model at the Magic show
I'm drinking out the bottle with two models at a fashion show
Four niggas be like Gucci Mane, remember from a long time ago
I smoked so much weed that I don't even have no time no more
I got them stupid bands like five, six, seven, I can't even count no more
No hopping out, no sporting no more, I'm hustling like I'm selling dope
Niggas take me for a joke and shit but I find it hysterical
I'm thirty? then I was like ten years ago
Ten broads with me, they're fine you see, they know they cover Maybelline
Catch your friend, it ain't a dream, It's Gucci Mane come join my team
Uh oh, uh oh, no I'm not from Orlando
I just got that magic stick, I'm balling like the pros do

Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favors

[Wooh Da Kid:]
Wooh Da Kid I do it big, everything is major
Hello to the big leads, goodbye to my haters
You can stack Louie shoes, imma' stack paper
Similar to a fat boy, cause I'm caked up
Wait, stop, baby just relax
You don't need your car keys, my shofer handles that
She's flexing like all this shit, just don't amaze her
Never been a super hero so I cannot save her
Bricksquad records, yeah we get dough
Ink drops on the paper, made that money
Grow
It's feeling like the 90's, I'm getting dough
For Gucci, I burn you and leave you dying

[Gucci Mane:]
Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favors

It's a flavor foul, every time I leave my house
Iced out, bling blaw wow, slide you out
And I don't love her, she don't love me, she drives me wild
Chain out, take my car, cause she whining now
It's Gucci time, Bricksquad, yeah my goons allowed
And I'm noxious, I'm crazy, they so thugged out
They got them choppers, them carbons, you riding bitch
I'm getting dressed with Gatorade like I won the pennant
On the pennant for the million, quarter million, half a million
Whole ticket, whole ticket, gotta get it, gotta get it
Like the real niggas did it when they did it, when they did it
When I say that I serve my city like tenants

Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favors

"Recently"
(feat. 50 Cent)



[Intro:]
Recently I approach, the microphone, cause I ain't no joke
Recently I approach, the microphone, because I ain't no joke
Recently, recently, recently, recently...

[Gucci Mane:]
She want to sex me of course
Cause I pull up in a Porsche
I make love to the money
But she get moist off my voice
Got a shit load of hundreds
Got a bag full of loud
Got a hand full of 20's
I threw that shit in the crowd
I'm playing 50 and Gucci
Don't play with 50 or Gucci
Cause they got goonies that do you
That hit your ass with the uzi
All my fans protest at my most recent arrest
I smoke nothing but the best
Here a toast of success
And little mama want to creep with me
I know she want to sleep with me
It gotta be the g in me
Cause ain't no R&B in me
Mr. Icecream man call me Mr. TMZ
Like a blindfolded man niggas ain't seeing me
It's Gucci

I just brought a drop just recently
I killed the parking lot just recently
I just brought a whip just recently
I made another flip just recently
I just bust a check just recently
I bust a bad bitch just recently
I'm screaming out "who want a piece of me?!"
I just got a deal just recently

[50 Cent:]
50 and Gucci nigga this shit equals bread
Homie fuck with the paper, I'm trying to take off your head
We get the check from the music, we get the cash from the track
When it comes to the money nigga we right where its at
Where it at! where it at! where it at! where it at! here it is!
The sickest shit, we filthy fucking nigga rich
Always on some crazy shit, blame it on some baby shit
Lambo round that autobahn, speeding like I bought a lot
Ain't got to talk to get a bitch, what you think we bought it for
Catch me riding solo, you know I got the strap
That pistol like them pills hoe you know I'm popping that
I hit that button on your block and drop the top on my convertible
I'm known to find a nosey rat but ain't nobody heard of you
They call me king, cha-ching that money coming in
Man everything I seen is over cause I'm hood
My pinky ring, that's stacks, man that's a hundred rats
The way it bling makes dope boys want to move crack

[Gucci Mane:]
I just brought a drop just recently
I killed the parking lot just recently
I just brought a whip just recently
I made another flip just recently
I just bust a check just recently

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Ferrari Boyz"
(with Waka Flocka Flame)



[Intro]
{LISTEN TO THE TRACK, BITCH}
Get out my lane [8X]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm in the yellow thang, on the expressway
That bitch so nasty it might give a bitch road rage
Get out my lane - Ferrari Boyz
You see the chain - So Icey boys
I'm ridin in a mansion, but I don't think I'm fancy
But I cut the blinker on and my diamonds dancin
Once upon a time, a little while ago
There was a nigga in a 'rarri with a pretty yellow hoe
Got my head held up, cause I think I'm handsome
As the media portrayin me as Charles Manson
And I coulda bought a Phantom, road here four deeper
But I'd rather pull up solo in the yellow two-seater
Gucci!

[Chorus 4X: Gucci Mane]
Get out my lane! Ferrari Boyz
You see the chain - So Icey boys

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Riding in the 'rarri same color as Bacardi
She don't like me shawty man she like my car
Damn near wanna fuck my chain, damn near wanna fuck my name
Wanna bust every nigga in the clique I claim
Deep-dish rims ain't no offsets mane
That's how me and Gucci Mane came
Iced out poppin shit, drunk switchin lanes
I rock bandanas like Santana, screamin out "Who want some anna?"
Made a million off my words, they in love with my country grammar
That's the antenna, cause these rap nigga careers got static in it
I'm a walkin meal ticket, just wait a minute
Bank account got commas in it, all black 'rarri know the llamas in it
I hear them talkin gangsta shit but I know they lame as hell
One thing I ain't gon' do, pussy nigga you scared of jail
My name ring bells, my engine loud as hell
Shit, my 'rarri cost about 230 bails

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 4X]
I'm just lane changin, chain swangin [3X]
{FERRARI BOYZ}

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"15th And The 1st"
(with Waka Flocka Flame, feat. YG Hootie)



[Intro]
Uhh, uhh
Ayy Guc' Mane, we good right now man
Get money good man

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's a white girl in town - name is Cocaine
It's some dirty birds in town - Gucci Mane & Waka Flame
We fly in, on buy-in, say you got more birds? You lyin
You tryin and lyin, you boys ain't supplyin
I pitch like Nolan Ryan, got cocallina flyin
My partners stick up kids, duct tape rope they gon' tie in
In the bushes they lyed in all night that's my word
By the end of the mornin they left with them birds
And I'm gone off that purp', and I'm slurrin my words
I swerved in my Benz, bangin my 4G's on the curb
The lean, the herb, pay me like the first
You cross Brick Squad, get hurt
I got work - Gucci

[Chorus]
My homeboys will get you, pay you on the 33rd
Two pints of lean'll have me slurrin on my words
Undertaker car, triple black drop bird
Stomach full of money, so hundreds I'ma burp
All the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st
Two pints of lean'll have me slurrin on my words
Undertaker car, triple black drop bird
Stomach full of money, so hundreds I'ma burp
All the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Five grand for a head shot
Boy don't be no Flintstone and get yo' (Bedrocked), nigga!
Triple red drop, offsets through the parkin lot
Where I'm from, young niggaz shootin at the cops
Where I'm from, they fakin
My hood right side, nigga, green flaggin
Lay yo' ass down if you do too much braggin
Three case, four Glocks, nigga that's swaggin, ughh
Penalized, then goes the Packer-Man
What'cha hell, you would think it was a cracker-man
I don't know 'em bah-bah-bah-bah-back'em man
Fuck 'em den! Throw my stash in the club that there'll do
Every girl gettin past you
Send an ambulance on that ass I want that rent due
Robbin every nigga that ain't Hit Squad, Blood or Piru
FLOCKA!!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: YG Hootie]
Half a million dollar jewelry like "Fuck that bird!"
Niggaz screamin they want beef, I'm like (Roger That)!
My album didn't sell, so I'm layin niggaz down
Shootin every nigga, that burst leaves a fuckin frown
Forty carats on my bracelet, my Polo black
Niggaz talkin like they want beef, I'm wantin that
Seven grams in the Swisher, I'm gon' solo that
Ridin around with my strap like "Where they at?"
All these rap niggaz hold up, stole my Philly hat
You will never be a legend like the Gucci Mane
You will never be turnt up like my partner Flock'
You niggaz hoes I run your block when them choppers chop

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Break Her"
(with Waka Flocka Flame)



[Intro]
Brick Squad monopoly (ugh)
You know I'ma break her
Bitch come and choose up!
I just be on hard mayne
Me and old Gucci Mane

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Shhh, be quit, shhh, be quiet
She talkin like you wired, her ass think she hired
Take you to a place real private
Vick you down and let you suck my private
I have no feelings - I'm a cold hearted nigga
You might catch me wit'cha sister, autograph my picture
I won't never kiss her, pills weed and some liquor
He might fuck 'round the liquor, I'm gon' get her Visa
You know I'ma break her, I don't hear no cake bruh
Send her out get cake bruh, bitch be back by 8 uhh
Sunshine my money maker, TT that's my down bitch
CC got real loose from that, you would give shawty a stupid check

[Chorus]
You know I'ma break her
Bitch come and choose up!
I done stepped my game up
Got a house outta her
She done bought me rings bruh
Got a chain outta her
I just pimp hard mayne
Me and old Gucci Mane

[Gucci Mane]
Break-a-Bitch College, sugar pimp knowledge
Skeet in her mouth and the bitch just swallowed
Give her guidelines and the slut just followed [2X]
I'm on mine, I gots to grind, my rhyme for a reason
Yo sis is a streetwalker, workin procedures
Baby bought me this, baby bought me that
Gave me a brick and I turned it to crack
Make me wanna fuck her, gotta come back
Lil' short thang with a ass so fast
Menages, massages, she too wild, no flaugin
She choose up, I po' up, I'm two up, she bobbin
I'm a nuisance, no nonsense
I'm a monster, no conscience
No option, who want it? Haters get left, unconscious
Grind in the 'rarri every day like a Chevy
Smoke so heavy that the dub man smell me
Used to let a boy named Luke get to me
In the club drunk got to fightin already

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Feed Me"
(with Waka Flocka Flame, feat. Frenchie)



[Gucci Mane:]
200 pounds I grew that shit, You knew that shit, I do it that shit
Pulled up with a hundred pounds, bails and bricks, filthy rich
All I know is grind time, nickle dime, slime time
I Intercept like Prime Time
My mind gone like nine times
Call it engineering, Gucci might steal it
A new European, everybody peekin
Is robbing season, goons out searching
Lurking, surfing, call it reimbursement
Southside on the beat, Gucci on the street
Let me take a listen why not drive a [?]
Wow, pow, bricks right now
Slip and slide I'm glidin by
But I'm so high I just might die
Flocka told me go in! Roco told me go in!
PJ told me no end, my hand, I will throw in!
Gamble with the joker and end up in a shoot out
Wooh he on the lookout, Juice Man throwin cookouts

[Chorus:]
Im in the strip club, the girls looking like zombies on the pole
Theyre screaming feed me, feed me, feed me!
And when the club [?] we monsters making scary movies girls be
Screaming, screaming, screaming, screaming! [x2]

[Waka Flocka Flame:]
In the strip club shorty throwing up the racks
Gucci come my back, fifty stacks in the back
Mean mugging? Shorty I ain't worried bout that
Brick Squad Monopoly: we a wolf pack
Rolling in my zone, baby make the bootie clap!
Slapped her on the bootie like Im trying to hit that
How much it cost cause I charge your stack?
Bottles in the air, hell yeah, Im stoned!
Leaning left to right, double cup styrofoam
Im full of racks, just stacks on stacks
Never been a [?] only shop at Sax
Drinking Remy by the fifth
They say Waka Flocka got a gift
Six speeds, I just shift
Every blunt I lift
I'm higher than a motherfucker, think I might fall
Bad bitches always calling me
LeBron fucking James I ball, my G
Shut the fuck up bitch, clap that ass
White fans screaming "Waka Flocka, you rad"
Always catch me with a fucking red rag

[Chorus x2]

[Frenchie]
I got em like ah...
Love this nigga, two hoes slobbering on the pole
Screaming out loud I love this nigga!
[?] seen the same girls that work in Perfections
They say they came straight from Magic City
So I know don't gotta teach em no lesson!
Girls [?] my songs on
Put down those pom poms
Oriental, I think she's from Hong Kong
In the club full of ho zombies
Screaming out feed me
But I just got this stacks girl, it aint gonna be that easy!
Four girls leaving, they coming
All girls fucking they coming
Just like Gucci said I left a hundred dollars on the dresser
Just to show the bitch it ain't nothin'
If you think you coming home with me, youre fucking
You got much potential, I turn you into something
Get in my V, my music we bumpin'
You steady talking but I ain't hear nothin'

[Chorus x2]

Gucci Mane Lyrics




"Mud Musik"
(with Waka Flocka Flame, feat. Titi Boy aka 2 Chains)



[Intro]
Ughh, Flocka! Gucci! 'Rarri, Boyz!
Ay Tity Boi what's happenin mane?
We turnt up mane, shout to the whole city mane
Uhh, uhh, uhh (Brick Squad monopoly)

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Half a pint in my two liter, I just slow sip
This that mud drank, my 'rarri go hard in the paint
Pulled up dancin right, hopped out flexin ice
Niggaz'll give they life, just to live my life
Bitches yellin loud, walkin through the crowd
With a triple cup (po' po' po' me up)
'burry game clique, flags in the sky
Walkin through the God I swear to God I'm in the sky
Astronaut high, I'm that guy
Stacks on stacks, racks on racks
I keep mud on standby
Got some real niggaz that you cain't even stand by

[Chorus]
I just slow sip (po' po' po' me up)
Styrofoam cup (tri-tri-triple cup)
This that mud drank, fo' ounces and a one liter
This that mud drank, half a pint in my two liter
(Po' po' po' me up) styrofoam (tripled up)
(Po' po' po' me up) styrofoam (tripled up)
This that mud music, this that mud drank
Styrofroam cup (tri-tri-triple cup)

[Gucci Mane]
Styrofoam cup we po'n up, Gucci, Flock', blowin up
We so fuckin up, all our foes they be duckin us
I'm a jack boy, you a jackass
You must dress in the dark with yo' tacky ass
I'm Big Gucci, cool guap'
Got 80 grand in my khaki pants
Tity's on the scene, yeah that's my team
BSM yeah that's my scene
I'm a millionaire, that's reality
You want a mill' that's a fuckin dream
I'm on mine, got two nines
Throw my watch in the air to let time fly
I'm DUI, I'm too high
You heard that young nigga I'm too fly
Thugged out young nigga I'm 'bout my bread
Don't want no pussy girl givin me head
We ain't even gotta stop to use the bed
Ay-ain't no need to fuck up the spread
I'm drinkin, I'm thinkin
All the real niggaz we linkin
My Brick Squad all be down on hangin
Sippin lean done got me famous, Gucci!

[Chorus]

[Tity Boi]
Yeah, mud, mud, Gucci!
This that kickstand, campaign
Over they head like an airplane
Brang yo' gurl to the club 'round me
and my niggaz then she fail game
2 Chainz, I'm too much
Every time I fuck I get two nuts
Every time you see me I'm with two sluts
I ain't in or out 'less the Coogi cut
Promethazine, contraband
Told them folks we a country band
Brick Squad, duffle bag
Bunch of knucklehead niggaz sayin "Fuck the feds"
My bread long like Subway, Louis' on, unlazered
And I ain't talkin money when I hit you with this one caper
I need two mo', two liters
I got bass like two speakers
It must be (Do or Die)
cause these niggaz out here "Po' Pimpin"
All we doin is slow sippin
I be on that codeine
I got fo' zips
'Bout to po' it on this ice cream, ughh!

[Chorus]
